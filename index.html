            <p>Saqsaywaman is an Incan ruin that began construction in the 1440s and was deconstructed by the Spanish after the failed Inca Rebellion of 1536; only three megalithic walls remain. In 2009, portions of the wall crumbled due to excess water runoff from a recently installed, impermeable clay layer, just above the damaged portion.</p>
            <p>The goal of Miksad’s research is to prevent further damage by returning the site to its original drainage state using traditional Inca engineering practices. </p>

                    <p>The topography changed significantly during deconstruction of the site post-1536, since most of the accessible boulders were removed and used to construct the surrounding city of Cusco, Peru. Using first hand accounts, handdrawn maps, and aerial photography from the Dumbarton Oaks archives in Washington, D.C., I adjusted and rectified the images onto current topographical models to gain insight into original water flow and site structure.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Strategic Water Action Team used GIS analysis to identify and locate potential areas for stormwater retrofit in the Bellemeade Watershed of Richmond, Virginia. We used ArcGIS to calculate water savings and cost of retrofitting. Our proposal combined permeable pavement, green roof, reforestation, cistern use, and Filterra® boxes can reduce runoff during a 2-year, 30-minute storm by 300,000 gallons. This runoff reduction is the same as turning off 700 water hoses or half of an Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By far, my favorite function during this project was the Masonry function. It was able to dyanimcally detect browser width and select the optimal number of columns to display news items. Timing was a huge issue here, because the items were ranked by tag, timeliness, and relevance -- so you couldn't just insert items as they arrived. I implemented a "frisbee gating" function, which used the API call as a frisbee toss and an ordering function to only open the gate for the next sequential item, letting the other items wait in queue. As each item arrived, I added it sequentially across columns to most naturally use the HTML and CSS sructures for a masonry or brick-like appearance. To optimize user experience, we called items in small batches, triggering new calls as the user approached the bottom of the screen, creating an endless stream effect.</p>

        <p>I discovered MeteorJS while doing <a href="ux-design/index.html" target="_blank">freelance design work in Thailand</a>, because I wanted to move fast without maintaining my own databases.</p>
        <p>MeteorJS is a funny little creature. It is part of "reactive programming" which means that inherent to the framework structure, the client side view is immediately reactive to server side changes. It has a nice library of modules, and I would say that modularity is part of it's core philosophy as a coding language. Most files in the repo are very small, and hook into the HTML through template handlebar compilers such as Blaze, which offers the ability to process logic functions in HTML.</p>

          <p>Modularity and Reactivity</p>
          <p><span class="underlined">Modularity</span>: The app is separated into 'node_modules' which are external modules, and 'app-*' folders which carry small functions internal to the app. In this way, it's easier to debug and faster to load. This type of programming can be confusing because you can't read it all in one page and the program becomes very sensitive to timing.</p>
          <p><span class="underlined">Reactivity</span>: Any folder that says 'client' is visible only to the client-side browser, any folder that says 'server' is visible only to the server, and things inside 'lib' not under a 'client' or 'server' folder are visible to both. This makes the program very reactive and also very sensitive to timing issues.</p>

        <p>In January 2016, I started this project as an excuse to go to research symposiums in Boston, exploring the deep intersection of where mind meets matter. It was a throwing together of yin and yang, challenging the notion that technology is uncaring and masculine, and that compassion is irrational and feminine. It's also a riff on the concept of a technology being compassionate!</p>
        <p>I was a "seminar reporter" going to topics on genetic engineering, inflammation research, nanostructural engineering, and pharmaceutical development -- and then writing about it. My articles were very dry at first!</p>
        <p><span class="underlined">Storyline</span>: Soon the story began to emerge, and the dividing lines between disciplines and industry melted away. I began to interview not only scientists, but tech translation-alists and venture capitalists as well. I began to see that technology isn't separate from us, it is us just as much as we are it.</p>
        <p>My stories began to follow the technologies themselves, slicing across the looping verticals of <a href="ct/drug design/Series 1-2 Research in Medicine-Drug Design.pdf" target="_blank">science</a>, <a href="ct/drug design/Series 1-3 Technology in Medicine-Drug Design.pdf" target="_blank">engineering</a>, <a href="ct/drug design/Series 1-4 Business in Medicine-Drug Design.pdf" target="_blank">business</a>, and <a href="ct/drug design/Series 1-1 Trends in Medicine-Drug Design.pdf" target="_blank">context</a>. [print distribution]</p>
        <p><span class="underlined">Publishing</span>: During this time, I played around with publishing and worked with ideas around podcasting, <a href="ct/Magazine (Sample).pdf" target="_blank">magazine</a> [PDF], print, and email newsletters. Eventually I found that the daily demands of running a publishing business wore away at my original enthusiasm and drive, which was investigative research.</p>
        <p>Once I took a break from the business, I found that I was reading research papers, working on code projects, and reading books again -- my energy and enthusiasm had returned, and I now had greater insight into myself.</p>
