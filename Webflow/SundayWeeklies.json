Food Waste and Hunger in the&nbsp;U.S.</h4><p>Across 84 countries, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), discovered that American consumers spend the smallest share of income on food. Despite this relative wealth, the study found that 1 in 6 people in the U.S. faces hunger while 1 in 9 people around the globe go to bed on an empty stomach&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ers.usda.gov%2F\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a>.</p><p>This is what the USDA defines as&nbsp;<strong>food insecurity:</strong>&nbsp;the lack of access, at times, to enough food for all of a households’ members.</p><p>Poverty and food distribution are the largest factors behind hunger. When the food supply chain is inefficient, healthy and fresh foods become more expensive, leading to&nbsp;<strong>food deserts</strong>&nbsp;for the urban poor.</p><p>However, one man’s waste can be another man’s feast, and&nbsp;<strong>food waste</strong>, which has been a large problem in American cities now has the opportunity to become the source of a solution. According to the USDA study, the reasons for food waste differs between the developed and developing countries:</p><blockquote><em>While here in the U.S., food waste starts in the kitchen by preparing too much food or even letting it spoil in our fridge and cabinets; in the developing world is the complete opposite, food waste happens during harvest time, due to lack of access to technology and markets to sell the food produced, and poor infrastructure leading to pest infestations or mold during the storage process.</em></blockquote><p>Currently, social and government solutions to hunger are often aimed at alleviating poverty, as presented by the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ Report on Hunger and Homelessness&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fendhomelessness.atavist.com%2Fmayorsreport2016\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>&nbsp;which proposes: “more affordable housing, more jobs and increase in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fns.usda.gov%2Fsnap%2Fsupplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\" target=\"_blank\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>(SNAP) benefits are actions that should be taken to reduce hunger. Employment training programs, better paying jobs, affordable childcare, and higher wages are other important actions to take to reduce hunger.”</p><p>But in all that has been said,<strong>&nbsp;where can technology enter as a tool to enhance these social and government solutions?</strong></p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fdE-FkZrhFbWiDFRvndjHw.png\"></div></figure><h4>III. The Business of Food, Then and&nbsp;Now</h4><p>According to Andrew Smith in his book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublisher.abc-clio.com%2F9781610698597%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Food in America: The Past, Present, and Future of Food, Farming and the Family Meal</em></a>, the 18th century brought significant changes for American farming. Advanced European agricultural practices, like organic fertilizers, crop rotation, and selective livestock breeding, began to be adopted by some farmers. Moreover, farmers ate what they grew, and the excess production was sold or exchanged with people they knew at the local markets.</p><p>In the 20th century, there was a rapid growth on American farming. The production and size increased, while the number of workers decreased. One of the reasons for this rapid growth,&nbsp;<strong>was the adoption of gasoline powered farm equipment</strong>, which boost the production of some crops, such as wheat.</p><p>Today the food industry transforms nearly 2 million raw farm commodities into consumer food and beverage products, sold through approximately 680,000 retail stores and food service outlets, with the U.S. leading in exports of processed food, accounting for more than half of food and agricultural exports.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fdE-FkZrhFbWiDFRvndjHw.png\"></div></figure><h4>IV. From Farm to Plate, Gaps in the Supply&nbsp;Chain</h4><p>Today, when we enter a grocery store, oftentimes we don’t realize the whole process encountered by our food to get into our fridges and cabinets. In fact, going to your neighborhood&nbsp;<strong>farmers market</strong>&nbsp;is a great way to learn just how many hands and hours it takes to get from farm to marketplace.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*OyuKqCRGE34m1JZyUU8Trg.jpeg\"></div><figcaption>Farmers Market at Du Pont Circle, Washington, D.C. every Sunday.

And let’s not forget, the food supply chain also needs to generate profits and benefits to our society, without overusing natural resources.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fLuwqmwtr0fRNzGX3zysFw.jpeg\"></div><figcaption>Global Harvest Initiative (<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalharvestinitiative.org%2Findex.php%2Fgap-report-gap-index%2F2013-gap-report%2Fgap-report-2013-infographics%2F\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.globalharvestinitiative.org/index.php/gap-report-gap-index/2013-gap-report/gap-report-2013-infographics/</a>)</figcaption></figure><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fdE-FkZrhFbWiDFRvndjHw.png\"></div></figure><h4>V. Solving Food Waste Through Technology</h4><p>As with many other industries, food is facing another series of growth in the age of Internet, automation, and renewed focus on environmental sustainability. Below are some innovative uses of technology to reduce food waste and tighten the gaps in the supply chain, ultimately allowing healthier food to get to the poorest in the nation who need it most.</p><h4>Solution #1: Reducing Consumer&nbsp;Waste</h4><p>Using technology and smart solutions can help to reuse and reallocate resources that would be thrown away, reducing the waste and possibly helping smallholders that once had no market to sell and reducing hunger by giving a second chance to this food. Thinking of this, Rafael Espinal, Jr., Council member for the 37th district in Brooklyn and the Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs, introduced a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flegistar.council.nyc.gov%2FMeetingDetail.aspx%3FID%3D539517%26GUID%3D232ECB68-A358-40F9-8C36-26EEDC4AB5C4%26Options%3D%26Search%3D%2520https%3A%2F%2Fendhomelessness.atavist.com%2Fmayorsreport2016\" target=\"_blank\">legislation [3]</a>, in March of this year, that would facilitate&nbsp;<strong>food donations through a web portal</strong>.</p><p>Through this portal food donors and recipients can post notifications with the availability of the food and arranging the transportation or withdrawal of the food. With this initiative he aims to help 16.4% of New Yorkers who claim not having access to a nourishing meal.</p><h4>Solution #2: Distributing Producer&nbsp;Surplus</h4><p>Another idea from the city of New York, is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityharvest.org%2F\" target=\"_blank\">City Harvest</a>, that rescues all surplus food from grocers, farms, restaurants and manufacturers, and gives it&nbsp;<strong>a second chance by distributing it free of charge</strong>&nbsp;to food pantries, soup kitchens and other community food programs. City harvest has operated since 1982, and since then has helped to collect and distribute 55 million pounds of excess food, and accounts with more than 15,oo0 volunteers each year.</p><p>Also considered the “nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization”,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.feedingamerica.org%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Feeding America</a>&nbsp;has developed a network of 200 food banks, and 60,000 food programs, by partnering with local businesses, government, individuals and charities. One of their works is&nbsp;<strong>food recovery</strong>, and by using innovative ideas they have rescued 2.8 billion pounds of food.</p><p>One example of these innovative ideas, is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmealconnect.org%2F\" target=\"_blank\">MealConnect</a>, one of their newest innovations. The platform connects businesses of all sizes to post their surplus of food, that is available for&nbsp;<strong>immediate pick-up by the best-suited food program or food bank.&nbsp;</strong>The technology was funded with help from General Mills, Google.org and the Walmart Foundation.</p><h4>Solution #3:&nbsp;Data</h4><p>Using data and an informational platform,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fsmarterplanet%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsmarter_cities%2Foverview%2F\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Smarter Cities</a>&nbsp;initiative wants to educate companies and cities on how to improve their operations by knowing how to manage waste. IBM believes in the concept of a circular economy, where waste is seen as an asset, and it can be restored either as a material or an energy, lowering costs and maximizing profits.&nbsp;</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fdE-FkZrhFbWiDFRvndjHw.png\"></div></figure><h4>VI. Microsoft Leads by&nbsp;Example</h4><p>Last year, Microsoft’s 500-acre Redmond, WA campus was recognized with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fgreen%2F2016%2F11%2F28%2Fmicrosofts-redmond-campus-500-acres-and-zero-waste%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Gold Level of Zero Waste Certification</a>&nbsp;given by the U.S. Zero Waste Business Council.</p><p>Working as a team, growing their own vegetables and preparing all meals from scratch; using only compostable or recyclable packaging in the kitchen; converting frying oil into source of energy; using local partners, and partners that share this zero waste mindset,&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft became the first technology company to get this recognition and get to a 87 percent mark in their zero waste management goals.</strong></p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fdE-FkZrhFbWiDFRvndjHw.png\"></div></figure><h4>VII. Big Questions for Technologists</h4><p>With such a complex issue as hunger, technology is not the only solution, but it is a reliable source of help. Creating conscious and empathy would be a good way to start. Empathy to understand that when you throw away food, you may be throwing away someone else’s food; conscious that our decisions as consumers can help us creating a better nourished world.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Fg4YNamvQjRNd5qygnccMg.png\"></div></figure><h4>I.

How do you feel about technology?</blockquote><p>I hope to learn what people really need, what is their context in life? How did they become American? How do they feel about their status in life, and how do they feel about technology? What does AI mean to them? How do they feel about God and humanity?</p><p>These are not separate topics, but are all intimately connected — because that’s the equal part beauty and equal part frustration of the way the human brain is wired.</p><p>We are feeling machines that happen to think.

Fundamentals of Computation: Control and&nbsp;Binaries</h4><p><strong>T</strong>here are many ways to build a computer, so why do we use silicon? It all boils down to electrochemistry, the same rules that govern the neurons in our brains.&nbsp;Ultimately, whatever material we use, needs to be easy enough for humans to control — and binary enough to send out information in its most practical form, the 1 or 0.</p><blockquote><em>Not enough control. Quantum computing.</em></blockquote><p>For a long time, the smallest individual unit of matter was an atom and the smallest unit of information was a bit. That’s been challenged in the last century because once you get smaller than atoms, into the subatomic realm, the world begins to run on quantum mechanics, which exhibits “quantum weirdness” — when our intuition about the way the world works no longer applies at the quantum scale.</p><p>No longer are things binary, but rather information exists in qubits (“quantum bits”) which are the quantum spin states of various types of subatomic particles. In fact, in the quantum world, the mere act of knowing something negates your knowing it. Things no longer exist in binary, they exist in “both 1 and 0 at the same time” or “kind of 1, almost 0” — in other words, it’s weird. And it’s so small that we can’t really observe or control it. Yet.</p><blockquote><em>Too much effort. Magnetic computing.</em></blockquote><p>Magnetism is another way of computing that is very binary, but requires a huge amount of power to set the initial state. According to the rules of electromagnetism, where electricity generates a magnetic field and vice versa — you have to be really careful about having both things too close to each other. There are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/08/03/tilt-magnetic-memory-chip/\" target=\"_blank\">magnetic chips made of tantalum [1]</a>&nbsp;that have very low power requirements, but because they are hard to manufacture at scale, they pale in comparison to existing silicon transistor chips.</p><p>So now we get to the answer, why silicon? And what is a transistor?</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h4>III. Physics of the Transistor: Silicon&nbsp;Doping</h4><p><strong>A</strong>transistor is the smallest unit of logic in a computer. It’s a switch that either allows electrons to flow through signaling a 1, or it’s disconnected and no electrons can go through and it’s a 0.</p><p>You can use many types of materials to make a switch, but the modern day digital revolution uses the marvelous material of doped silicon. With this material we have enough control over the manufacturing process to drive the cost and size of the silicon transistors down to the size of nanometers.</p><blockquote><em>You could fit 10 state-of-the-art transistors onto the cell body of one neuron at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/8991/intel-at-isscc-2015-reaping-the-benefits-of-14nm-and-going-beyond-10nm\" target=\"_blank\">price of 10 cents per transistor [2]</a>.&nbsp;Wowzas!</em></blockquote><p>Silicon by itself, without the doping, forms a very stable crystal that is so perfectly arranged there is no room for electrons to flow through. Since electrons flow in the spaces between atoms, doping the silicon with a small amount of another material creates just enough space for electrons to travel.</p><p>If you dope the silicon with a small amount of something that is either lacking or has an extra electron, then electrons can either be sucked into the empty spaces or holes which travel down the wire (positively charged or P-doping) or the electrons travel like a chain of dominoes down a structure which has a bunch of free-floating electrons (negatively charged or N-doping).</p><p>When current flows from N-doped to P-doped materials it’s like water flowing up a waterfall (see image below). It just doesn’t work unless it has some extra help to level the playing field. Going the other way though, it works just fine.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*6-9mLW8qRF1cgS6z.\"></div><figcaption>The chemistry of a transistor’s PN&nbsp;junction</figcaption></figure><p>The entire backbone of transistors lies on a sandwich of these materials, either in a PNP or NPN configuration.

The Neuron as a Biological Cell</h4><p><strong>N</strong>eurons are cells just like any other cell. They have a squishy, sac-like cell body which has another sac inside (the nucleus) which contains all your genetic information. Inside the cell body is a sea of cytoplasm, which houses a factory of organelles that are working together constantly to create and assemble the basic building blocks of the neuron.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*4pg1bjQs1_B3XUr7.\"></div><figcaption>The neural cell body, dendrites, and axons (Credit: LadyOfHats)</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike most cells, neurons do not divide constantly. Once they mature, they are there for life, but that doesn’t mean that they don’t change. Neurons are constantly growing new dendritic spines and the axons can move, grow and repair themselves.</p><p><strong>Neurons are even known to be quite the risk takers</strong>&nbsp;in that they are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083085/\" target=\"_blank\">constantly modifying their own genes [1]</a>, through a cutting process called methylation. When correctly applied, the process does not modify the gene sequence, but rather turns genes on and off by adding and removing a methyl group to certain base pairs.&nbsp;However, it’s risky because there is a small moment when the DNA is cut, open and exposed — and in that moment, the wrong base pair could slip in, causing a genetic mutation.</p><p>Why do neurons take this risk? Because it allows them to learn and adapt to their environment.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/neurons_constantly_rewrite_their_dna\" target=\"_blank\">By modifying gene expression they can increase or decrease the threshold for action potentials [2]</a>, the number and type of synapses, and the amount of ion channels in their membranes. All of these modifications change how a neuron computes the ultimate decision to fire a binary action potential.

The Neuron as an Electrochemical Wire</h4><p><strong>So</strong>now, the neuron shifts its identity from a squishy biological cell to an electrochemical highway.

To answer these questions, we need to look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21535/\" target=\"_blank\">structure of a neuron [3]</a>.</p><p>You can imagine a neuron as a tree. From the seed of the cell body, dendrites grow densely downward absorbing neurotransmitters and relaying charged currents — while axons grow long and upward, branching out at the top sending out neurotransmitters and relaying action potentials.</p><blockquote><em>Neurons speak to each other in two ways: the electrical way of action potentials is really fast but carries only binary information, the chemical way of neurotransmitters is slower but carries more complex information.</em></blockquote><p>In the electrical world, everything is relative, and action lies in potential. A charge exists only in relation to its external environment. The dendrites and axons of a neuron are tubes of salt water in a sea of more but different salt water.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ic.ucsc.edu/~bruceb/psyc123/neuron.html\" target=\"_blank\">chemical world becomes electrical [4]</a>&nbsp;when the relative concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions on both sides dictate the potentials — and sets the stage for the electrical computations that follow.</p><p>In general, the inside of a neuron is stable and more negative than the outside, except when: a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11009/\" target=\"_blank\">chemical synapse [5]</a>&nbsp;receives a neurotransmitter or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11164/\" target=\"_blank\">electrical synapse [6]</a>&nbsp;receives an action potential.</p><p>At this point, a series of chemical and electrical activities occur and the neuron becomes a computer with a decision to make: to fire or not to fire? 1 or 0?</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h4>IV. The Neuron as an Information Computer</h4><p><strong>T</strong>he general rule is that charge in a neuron travels only in one direction: it originates from many dendrites, is aggregated in the cell body, and then binarily sent through the axon — only if it exceeds a certain threshold at a certain point in time. These are the rules.</p><p>Of course, there are exceptions. And any data scientist will tell you that a solid system is able to handle exceptions. So no, the neural computer does not have to be perfect. It just has to work most of the time.</p><p>What makes the neuron a computer is that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/research/how-do-neurons-compute-output-their-inputs\" target=\"_blank\">it receives many inputs from its dendrites [7]</a>, which are connected to the axons of hundreds or thousands of other neurons.

What Makes Us Uniquely&nbsp;Human?</strong></h4><p><strong>A</strong>nd another common question: what separates us from animals? Most of the answers lie in the questions themselves.</p><p>1. We have the need to classify and separate objects into hierarchies — with ourselves uniquely at the top, of course. In the question, we’ve&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;separated ourselves, tingeing all results with an<strong>&nbsp;inherent value bias</strong>.</p><blockquote><em>The more accurate question is: what separates us from&nbsp;<strong>other</strong>&nbsp;animals?</em></blockquote><p>2. We do this, because our neurons are designed to&nbsp;<strong>classify and separate&nbsp;</strong>information and place them in a hierarchy. Extending past thought and into human operation, we find that at every level of society we are constantly defining, labeling, judging, and placing other people and countries into a hierarchy — with ourselves at the top, of course.</p><p>3.&nbsp;How many other animals do you find even asking these questions? Humans have the unique ability to be&nbsp;<strong>self aware</strong>, to have an inner life, thoughts, and emotions separate from the outside world.</p><blockquote><em>This phenomenon is often called&nbsp;<strong>‘consciousness’</strong>. We all know what it is, but when asked to define it things get really vague, really&nbsp;quickly…</em></blockquote><p>5.&nbsp;.. in that empty wake of uncertainty, spirituality flourishes. We simply need to know, and we’ll be very&nbsp;<strong>creative</strong>&nbsp;to fill in the knowledge gaps. Another hallmark of humanity.</p><p>6. It’s that same creativity that enables us to construct beautiful lands of fantasy that operate outside the laws of physics within our minds. From our fantasies we are sometimes able to create reality, to manifest our own destiny. That’s where&nbsp;<strong>technology</strong>&nbsp;comes in.</p><p>6. In a uniquely human experience, we can&nbsp;<strong>evolve</strong>&nbsp;with our own creations, tumbling in an endless melding of fantasy and reality.</p><blockquote><em>But let’s say that, for the purposes of this article, what makes us special all begins with&nbsp;<strong>consciousness</strong>.</em></blockquote><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h4><strong>III. What’s The Mind With&nbsp;Matter?</strong></h4><p><strong>T</strong>he richness of conscious experience somehow emerges from the massive network of neurons that makes the human brain. Somehow, the sum of the individual parts is greater than the whole.</p><p>The concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/the-spiritual-reductionist-consciousness-of-christof-koch\" target=\"_blank\">integrated information theory</a>&nbsp;is an attempt to put a metric (Φ) to consciousness. How much more conscious is a human than a dog? A dog than a bee? A worm, a plant? Even a rock? Could a rock, plant, worm, or a bee even be conscious? And to what extent?</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" data-rt-max-width=\"100%\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0HWmLFIN4_Vs7ZUpp1oMPA.png\"></div></figure><p>Humans and other mammals like dogs, monkeys, and rats have brains with thinking systems (a neocortex) and feeling systems (the amygdala and limbic system). An insect,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-bees-have-feelings/\" target=\"_blank\">like a bee for example</a>, could have a few million neurons in its brain, which is far fewer than the billions in the human brain. Therefore, is it less conscious?</p><p>Some worms, on the other hand, have neurons throughout their body. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-feelings-the-second-brain-in-our-gastrointestinal-systems-excerpt/\" target=\"_blank\">our own stomach is lined with ~500 million neurons</a>&nbsp;and is basically a gigantic, inside-out worm-brain that processes food.&nbsp;Does that make our stomachs conscious?</p><p>Plants grow towards the sun and sexually reproduce,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.beesmatter.ca/plant-reproduction-and-the-role-of-honey-bees/\" target=\"_blank\">some species can only do so with the help of bees</a>.&nbsp;You can argue that bees might then be the brains of plants, the minds of the matter.</p><p>And then, at the most basic level, you have rocks — generally ordered collections of atoms like carbon and silicon. Some rocks are structured in beautiful crystals that symbolize everlasting love, other arrangements are so dense and hot that they make the molten core of the earth. Other arrangements look more like mud.</p><blockquote><em>If humans evolved from the basic elements of the earth, then is each conscious element part of the brain of&nbsp;nature? </em><em><strong>Is consciousness then not uniquely human, but simply&nbsp;</strong><strong>the mind of&nbsp;matter?</strong></em></blockquote><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h4><strong>IV. Alone In A Crowd, Or At One With The Universe?</strong></h4><p><strong>T</strong>he integrated information theory posits that maximal potential for consciousness exists as an optimization between conflicting variables of ‘separateness’ and ‘integration’.

Imagine a large ballroom full of people, except nobody is aware of anybody else. No one is speaking or even making eye contact. They even move through each other like&nbsp;ghosts. I don’t know about you, but this would be living hell for me.</p><p>This is total separateness.&nbsp;No new information can be shared or even experienced.&nbsp;Any consciousness that might have existed at the beginning of the party, would slowly fade away as our minds, starved for information, would start looping on repeat and then eventually stop working all together.</p><p>Now, over to the integration extreme, imagine that every person is communicating with every other person simultaneously through some sort of magical, rapid-transmission BrainLink tech. In this case, there is also no new information, and consciousness grinds to a halt.</p><p>I can’t tell you what Becky said because you already know what Becky said. In fact, you know everything that Becky is thinking and feeling, because at this point of maximal integration — you are Becky, and Becky is you. The individual ceases to exist and instead becomes one large, massive unit.</p><blockquote><em>So the theory goes, that yes, you can measure potential for consciousness, if you can map the&nbsp;network. </em><em>If the network is sufficiently integrated and disintegrated (what a conundrum) then consciousness can&nbsp;emerge.</em></blockquote><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\" alt=\"\"></div></figure><h4><strong>V.

In the model where we separate our evolution from technology, we risk becoming so different from our child-technologies that there is no communication or collaboration between generations. We would erase ourselves from an ecosystem that we ourselves created.</p><p>It begs the question, who are we? I believe that our selves are a combination of the stories we tell ourselves (our software), the social ties that support us (our network), and the physical bodies that sustain us (our hardware).</p><blockquote><em>Human&nbsp;:: Machine<br></em><em>Stories&nbsp;: Software<br>Social&nbsp;: Network<br>Bodies :&nbsp;Hardware</em></blockquote><p>These aspects of ourselves exist in a delicate balance, one which we don’t yet fully understand.

Dam operators have difficult jobs, balancing the need to maximizing electricity production with appropriately evaluating flood risk and releasing water early (losing electricity) in order to prevent flooding.</p><h4>II. Human Problems: Crying Wolf, Accountability and&nbsp;Risk</h4><p>The need to balance saving your job with saving lives is a difficult decision faced not only by dam operators; it is an industry-wide problem for those who provide humanitarian aid.</p><p>In the face of weather emergencies, government officials are hesitant to pull the trigger on fund disbursement or evacuation protocols for fear of “crying wolf”, receiving criticism and and budget cuts for false alarms. As a result, they often wait until an environmental disaster is obvious and imminent before issuing evacuation protocols, at which point it’s usually too late.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.climatecentre.org/news/833/red-cross-shares-in-global-innovation-award-at-world-government-summit-in-uae\" target=\"_blank\">Forecast-based financing</a>&nbsp;(FbF), which uses computational algorithms to predict weather emergencies, assigns risk probabilities and recommends action such as fund disbursement or evacuation, provides documented risk analysis outside the realm of human judgment and blame. Every step in the decision-making is recorded and accountable, allowing iterative adjustments of the algorithms that evaluate risk and determine action.</p><h4>III. Computer Problems: Designing for Human Factors in the Data Landscape</h4><p>Machine learning was considered for this project, but machines can’t learn without data. In designing an effective computational solution for a problem, you have to deeply understand the human factors that shape the data landscape.</p><p>For example, the technology infrastructure in Togo is not yet developed enough for automated hydrometeorological data collection, which means flood prediction data needs to be manually collected.</p><p>Herman Dolder therefore designed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/funes-model-less-model-herman-dolder\" target=\"_blank\">‘functional estimation’ tool or FUNES</a> to heavily rely on a time series of one simple measurement: rainfall. The model acts as a ‘village elder’, by remembering past information and finding the most similar situation and applying some extrapolations in order to make a prediction for future flood risk. This gives dam operators data-backed reasoning to handle flood events as opposed to following a set of predefined standard operating procedures.</p><h4>IV. Human-Computer Solution: A Computer Serves as Togolese ‘Village&nbsp;Elder’</h4><p>In 2015 the FUNES model was tested when&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.climatecentre.org/news/798/at-d-c-days-virtual-reality-puts-players-in-driving-seat-on-disaster\" target=\"_blank\">the Togolese government trained 1,000 Red Cross volunteers</a>&nbsp;to collect water level data downstream the Nangbeto Dam on the Mono River and enter it into the FUNES tool via text message.</p><p>The results shown below show that the algorithm did in fact reduce peak flooding from a single large incident of 900 cubic meters of outflow to two smaller incidents of 800 cubic meters. This reduction in peak flow is enough to prevent water from escaping its channels and damaging crop land and homes, while maximizing for electricity production at the dam.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/funes-model-less-model-herman-dolder\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IyBqvyGXcvYMztZ1_-EU7g.png\"></div></a><figcaption>(click to see more of Dolder’s&nbsp;work)</figcaption></figure><p>The model however, is only as good as the data provided. Dolder points out that “on a nice day you get 20 inputs [from volunteers], when it rains you have zero”, and sometimes people guess the rainfall instead of going to the river to measure.</p><blockquote><em>“On a nice day you get 20 inputs [from volunteers], when it rains you have zero”, and sometimes people guess the rainfall instead of going to the river to measure.</em></blockquote><p>However, with new satellites going into orbit dedicated to geo-monitoring that have unprecedented visual precision in combination with low-cost weather stations built on Raspberry Pi for under $100 (as opposed to current weather stations billed at several thousand), the problem of human error and too little data are likely to be reduced — opening the door for applied machine learning in climate science and forecast-based financing.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*QjE93OQcWxlNdYertL22hA.png\"></div></figure><h4>V.

Well, yes — some DNA was modified by natural breeding, some of it was modified by selected breeding, and some was modified <strong>transgenically</strong>, which means DNA from other organisms were spliced in.</p><p>Where’s the worry? Yes, it is possible to engineer a human-loving virus into plants and animals. Before you get scared though, consider the viruses and parasites that exist already in our meat, there’s a reason why you don’t eat uncooked pork. The heat of cooking denatures harmful parasites, proteins and DNA, turning deadly microscopic tapeworms into just some more crunch.</p><h4>Is it worth the risk to use&nbsp;GMOs?</h4><p>Hunger and malnutrition are real problems in many parts of the world.

But are emotions are bad?</p><h4>How Much Emotion is Best for Decision Making?</h4><p>In the early 1990s,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/528151/the-importance-of-feelings/\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">Antonio Damasio</a>&nbsp;studied patients whose emotional brain centers had been destroyed by cancer, but whose reasoning centers were otherwise intact. He discovered that too few emotions leads to ineffective and slow decision making as the thinker processes every possibility with little motivation to pick one option over the other - “paralysis by analysis”.</p><p>It turns out that emotions are necessary for decision making. Our body dictates values, such as “<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101334645\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">dopamine is good</a>” and “pain is bad”. Our mind can only hold 5-9 items at once, and is not able to process all the activities going on ranging from the cellular level all the way up to seeking an attractive mate.</p><p>That’s where emotions come in. They are our body’s computational system, taking in all the external cues that our brains can’t process and delivering “simplified emotional feedback” such as tightness in your chest for anxiety, heat in your hands for anger, or warmth all over for love and happiness.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d120_emotion%20body%20map.jpg\"></div><figcaption>‍Love, it makes us warm all over &lt;3</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, our emotions give us a result without telling us why.

While the total number of possible algorithms that could yield solutions are mind-bogglingly large - the number of algorithms that actually work in real life (the life that games like Go exist in) are relatively few.</p><p>In fact, complex human behaviors such as aggression in the face of scarcity and the evolution of cooperative behaviors - were also replicated through a small set of algorithms in a virtual game played over many virtual-generations by Google’s DeepMind (see the paper here).</p><h4>The Big Questions for Technologists</h4><p>Just how human are emotions? If neural networks can evolve emotional behaviors, then maybe we should take a more computational look at ourselves.</p><p>Can we work together as biological intelligences standing side-by-side with artificial ones?

Because it makes being single that much easier</blockquote><p>If you walk through the streets in the evening, glancing into people’s homes and apartment windows, you see television and Netflix on. Imagine being single 50 years ago. There’s no endless stream of ad-free television to distract you from your loneliness. It’s that much extra motivation to get off the couch and go meet someone.</p><h4>Tons of Dating Apps, But Where’s the&nbsp;Money?</h4><p>So technology made a problem, it can make a solution too!

And how often do those dates move onto second dates? And how many dating apps do you even have on your phone?</p><p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/why-investors-dont-fund-dating/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Chen</a> talks about why investors don’t fund dating startups. A few reasons include ‘member churn’ and that dating has a shelf life. Meaning that about 20–30% of members drop each month (the lucky ones!) and you only aggressively date for a certain period in your life. It’s a highly ephemeral business, subject to the same shifting passions in the marketplace as in the bedroom, making it difficult for investors to fall in love with dating apps.</p><h4>The Next Generation of Dating&nbsp;Apps</h4><p>It’s well known that humans aren’t the best at being self aware.

In honor of this 20-day celebration held by over 1.4 billion Chinese, today’s newsletter is the first of a two part series on tech trends in China.</p><h4>Setting the&nbsp;Context</h4><p>China is a land that holds an air of mystery, elegance, and power. In the United States, China is regarded with both fear and respect, both a powerful trading ally and threat to domestic economics.</p><p>With a long dynastic tradition, the Chinese people have a shared history of over 2,000 years. China is large and rather ethnically homogenous, with 91% Han Chinese population and 55 minority groups comprising the other 9% — as opposed to the United States which has a majority non-Hispanic white population at 63% with the remaining 37% mostly split between Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*NW1zZA9rGCjL-Tli.\"></div><figcaption>A map of China overlayed onto the US (Smith2China)</figcaption></figure><p>China and the U.S. are roughly the same size, while China only has one economic seaboard on the east where it houses over 90% of its population on 30% of its landmass, with a sparsely populated minority desert and mountainous western region landlocked by the Russia and the “stan” region. Compared to the U.S which has economic powerhouses on both the east and west coasts, with an agricultural and mountainous central region.</p><h4>Cultural Differences</h4><p>As a westerner, to truly understand China, the most important difference to understand is that Chinese generally have a more collective attitude, while westerners are more independent. The western mindset can generally be described as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170118-how-east-and-west-think-in-profoundly-different-ways\" target=\"_blank\">WEIRD, or “western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic”</a>.</p><p>With over 2,000 years of shared history, the Chinese have strong cultural and binding roots dating back to Confucius in 550 BC. Yes, that’s over 500 years before Christ lived and died.</p><p>Shortly after Confucius left his mark, China was unified by their first emperor, the famous and ruthless commander Emperor Qin Shi Huang, said to have built the Great Wall of China over the bones of a million peasants. The unification of China (from the name Qin) is credited to him.</p><p>After this, for the next 2,000 years, there has always been tension between the ruling emperors and the peasants, with peasant revolts happening every several hundred years, cycling the dynasties and churning power.</p><h4>East Meets&nbsp;West</h4><p>For a long time, China was the technological center of the world. The Song Dynasty, from 960 to 1280 AD (while Europe was plunged in the dark ages) was a pinnacle of Chinese innovation. Gunpowder, paper, and moveable print among other inventions were brought into the world. In the 1500s, China had a powerful naval fleet led by Zheng He bringing Chinese influence to Africa with a rumored pre-Columbian discovery of America as well.</p><p>The Chinese have always had a strong sense of national pride. The country is named 中国 (zhōng guó) with the character 中 (zhōng) meaning “middle”, showing a line going straight through the center of a rectangle, symbolic for the center of the world.</p><p>The introduction of Christianity via the silk road and opium via naval trade with Europe brought China’s already weak Qing Dynasty to it’s knees in 1912, ushering China into the modern and global age. After years of power struggle and civil war between the western-backed Nationalist party and the peasant-backed Communist party, the current rule of order was established.</p><p>On October 1, 1949 Chairman Mao founded the People’s Republic of China under communist party rule while the western-backed Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-Shek held ground in Taiwan.</p><h4>Today: China, Land of Contradictions?</h4><p>Between 1949 and today, Chairman Mao and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pushed, pulled, and ushered China into the industrialized era. The Great Leap Forward into the western industrial age resulted in great famine in 1960, fast-forwarding to a three decade ‘feast’ with rapidly growing GDP along with 27% ownership of United States debt in 2016. But Americans, don’t worry, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/09/26/is-chinas-debt-problem-really-that-bad/#4959fd5c5ccd\" target=\"_blank\">China also has a significant debt problem of it’s own</a>.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*T_JvDPp8eKUCpEaj.\"></div><figcaption>Futuristic Anti-China Ad from Citizens Against Government Waste</figcaption></figure><p>Once the world center for innovation, Chinese students are now stereotyped as being “<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-say-Chinese-students-are-diligent-but-lack-creativity\" target=\"_blank\">diligent but lacking in creativity</a>”. With a large and relatively homogenous market, innovative American tech companies such as Facebook have been chomping at the bit to take a piece of megapie (see below). However, the Chinese government is incredibly protective over their marketplace, insisting on creating Chinese versions of Google products, Facebook, Twitter, and Uber.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*EUGJV6nhBTtCwORw.\"></div><figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Wish a Happy New Year in&nbsp;2016</figcaption></figure><p>While China is communist, it is one of the most practical, pragmatic, and entrepreneurial cultures — with Chinese all over the world as shopkeepers and money makers.

In the sudden void of mobile comms, I thought back to other protests and riots driven by social media, where the government responded with communication censorship. Here’s a reflection on social media, technology, and unrest since 2009.</p><p>The largest threat to any dictatorship or monarchy is the unrest of the people. The introduction of social media technologies layered on top of global communications creates a shift in government-civilian power dynamics, tilting and warping centuries old status quos into confusing Van Goghs.</p><p>Social media has driven protests and revolutions all around the world. Let’s take a look at a few, starting with the unrest in Muslim China in 2009, the Arab Spring in 2011, and the nationwide #WomensMarch following Trump’s inauguration just yesterday — we ask the question, how is our relationship with government changing?</p><h4>2009, Xinjiang Riot, China Censors Twitter and&nbsp;YouTube</h4><p>Watching footage from the Xinjiang riot is enough to make anyone sad for humanity. Strangers walking down the sidewalk threw cinder blocks at and kicked a poor man unlucky enough to already have been beaten. Crowds grabbing, shaking, flipping and burning cars. The mentality that exists in mob situations brings out the worst in all of us. A certain pleasure in savagery and violence that unrecognized and not dealt with, manifests in the worst of ways.</p><p>After the riots, China quickly shut down Twitter and YouTube within the country and dedicated resources to deleting posts from domestic social media sites like Founfou.com, China’s version of Twitter at the time.</p><p>The tensions that existed in the area have existed for a long time, with the Han Chinese (the majority race) being appointed to Uighur Xinjian (minorities) regions to tip the population scales in Han favor. While this arrangement has been by no means favorable to either party involved, the autonomous regions stayed in a rickety balance through the following exchange: Xinjiang is a large buffer to Muslim land and a large territory for China, China provides infrastructure and government support from a central location to a relatively sparsely populated area.</p><p><strong><em>The technological shift:</em></strong><em> Imagine now that the sparse and previously nomadic populations can communicate more frequently by social media and cell phones. They no longer need government support as much. What happens? How does the relationship change?</em></p><h4>2011, The Arab Spring, Catalyzed by Social&nbsp;Media</h4><p>In 2011, social unrest in the Arab world, across the Middle East and North Africa, blossomed into a series of protests and revolutions, taking international social media by storm. While social media was not the cause of unrest, it was a catalyst that merged many small pieces of burning kindling into a large and roaring fire. The results from the Arab spring being long term and lasting changes in the direction of democratic governance.</p><p>In Egypt, Wael Ghonim, a Google employee with more than 200,000 followers became active in helping throw off the scent and lead protests. In response, the Egyptian government shut down Internet access. Engineers at Google and Twitter then created Speak2Tweet, allowing direct voice-to-Tweet communications.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change\" target=\"_blank\">(see Wael’s TED Talk here on designing social media that drives real change)</a></p><p><strong><em>The technological shift:</em></strong><em> Before mobile communication and social media, a small protest in one village would burn out by the time news reached the next. Getting the right rhythm and frequency of unrest necessary for a larger revolution was difficult and risky. However, with social media, power went into the hands of the connected masses and out of the hands of militaristic or autocratic rulers.</em></p><h4>2017, The Women’s March, Born on Social&nbsp;Media</h4><p>Yesterday I had the wonderful experience of watching the Women’s March from a treetop in Boston Common. Tens of thousands of men and women gathered in a tidal wave to advocate for equal rights for people of all races, genders, religions or ability. Women gathered nationwide in major cities such as Washington, D.C., New York, and Chicago — all posting on twitter #WomensMarch, uniting the movement across the nation.</p><p>The spark? Donald Trump, and maybe he sure did make America great again by mobilizing women and other underrepresented populations to stand and march together. Not exactly the wall he was talking about during the election period, which was highly publicized on Twitter and Facebook, whose newsfeed algorithms may have fanned the flames of partisan divide.</p><p>Similar to the Rally for Sanity in 2010 in Washington, D.C., telecommunications were interrupted and I was unable to share or access Twitter, Instagram, or even message at the event. In rare situations like this, I truly realize and feel the power of mobile communications when I was suddenly left without.</p><p><strong><em>The technological shift:</em></strong><em> There have been other movements such as Occupy Wall Street in 2015 that were born on social media. The Occupy movement was much more violent, as opposed to the Women’s March where people seemed to be happy to be out and socializing under a common cause. However, lack of violence does not imply lack of effectiveness. There is an increased potential for action derived from the feelings of unity and cohesiveness that were generated today.</em></p><h4>The Big Questions for Technologists</h4><p>Will women’s groups be able to organize and strategically use social media to channel the potential for action in a controlled manner, versus the large and violent eruptions of the past?

Family gatherings and idle time for self-reflection, sandwiched between a mad rush to finish everything before the holidays - and a mad rush to get back on the ball after the holidays.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.stress.org/holmes-rahe-stress-inventory/\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory</a> shows that even “positive things” in our life, like getting married, falling in love, or starting a new job - are stressful life events. In that same vein, celebrating the new year, spending time with loved (and not so loved) ones is bound to also be stressful!</p><p>And then we’re throwing “self-reflection” onto the fire. In the United States, self-reflection usually amounts to “tearing one’s self apart” and setting unrealistic, difficult, and sometimes downright cruel (like ‘go to the gym for 2 hours a day, get skinny and don’t eat any bread, sugar, or carbs’, ouch!) expectations for yourself for the future.</p><p>So yes, if you’re stressed - there are a lot of reasons to be stressed. And…</p><h4><strong>It’s all going to be okay.</strong></h4><p>Our western culture promotes “the self”, coupled with a lot of guilt and shame. “I’m not good enough. I’m not thin enough. I have to be better to be liked. If people knew the truth about me, I’d be a nobody. Better, better, better…”</p><p>Does any of that sound familiar? Well, let’s look at it another way.</p><p>You’re a squishy machine. Not a silicon metal-based machine like an android robot, you’re a <strong>biological machine</strong>.</p><p>Imagine you wake up every morning, pleasantly surprised to find yourself in a human body. You look at your hands and are amazed at how they can move, rotate, and grab. How they can hold a delicate wine glass and also ball up into a fist and break a window. What amazing versatility, flexibility, and strength lies in your body!</p><p>And your processing systems too. It takes a bit of time to reboot in the morning, but after a few minutes you know who you are, where you are, and are usually processing the same problems (worrying) about the exact same thing you were processing right before you put yourself to sleep.</p><h4><strong>It’s nice to be a machine.</strong></h4><p>When you think of yourself as a human machine, it takes a lot of pressure away from existing. You no longer feel so much guilt and shame for things you can’t control, things that were coded into your software and hardware, like your sexuality, propensity for strong emotions, or fat distribution.</p><p>If someone judges you physically, well - it’s just their software passing a judgment on your hardware! And you can make some modifications, if it really matters… but ultimately you’re kind of limited with what you were born with.</p><p>And you’re also limited with age. That machine is going to break down if you put enough miles on it. Wrinkles on your face? Freckles? Neck sagging a bit? That’s just mileage and experience.</p><h4><strong>Having compassion for yourself.</strong></h4><p>At the root of compassion is understanding. Many of us have a lot of shame over things we don’t fully understand about ourselves.</p><p>For example, self-awareness is a huge bug in the human system. Our eyes face outwards, and we are acutely aware of others but have difficulty turning our gaze inward. And when we do turn our gaze inward, so many systems of cognitive biases and cultural messaging guide us straight into self-delusion. We think we are more aware than we are.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d11b_who%20am%20i.jpg\"></div><figcaption>The self-awareness bug.</figcaption></figure><p>If you set your mind to do something, like a new year’s resolution, and you find yourself dreading it, hating it, or masochistically becoming addicted to it - it’s okay! Because it’s just your self-awareness bug.</p><h4>Hacking the Self-Awareness Bug</h4><p>Don’t feel guilty, have compassion. For yourself. Take a step back, observe, learn, reevaluate - and then re-engage. Rinse and repeat until you’ve either accomplished your goal or have realistically readjusted your expectations.</p><p>It’s the “observe” part where “I’m a machine” thinking really helps. It’s a hack around the self-awareness bug. Once you zoom out, shift perspective, and stop thinking about yourself as yourself… your observations tend to become more accurate.</p><p>But be careful of taking this thinking too far. You’re a machine, but you’re also human. ;)</p>","cover-image-attributions":"<p>I'm Not a Robot (Marina and the Diamonds) - click to enjoy!</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=revue&amp;v=mH39MMZXkNM</p>","short-text":"Having a rough time with yourself after the holidays?

But before I paint a rosy picture of humans and artificial intelligences living together, side by side, happily ever after like in a Disney movie (or Bicentennial Man, see above), I want to start with the dark reality of 2016. A darkness so ever present that we can’t even smile past it anymore and pretend it doesn’t exist.</p><h4>The Dark Reality of&nbsp;2016</h4><p>Trump was elected. Brexit happened. #BlackLivesMatter now. We had a dark year in the United States. There was a lot of fear, talk of walls, talk of national registries, talk of separation. Fear sells and fear motivates.</p><p>Trump voters generally voted for fear of poverty, fear of being left behind, and fear of “others”. Clinton voters generally voted for fear of Trump. Trump won because he tapped into a more primordial fear than Clinton was able to. But when we look at ourselves, is that really who we want to be as a nation or as a human race?</p><p>Do we want to be so easily pushed around by fear? Or do we want to look at fear for what it is: a message that things are about to change. And whether that change is positive or negative, desirable or undesirable — our actions would come from a clear and aware mind, not from a foggy and frightened mind.</p><blockquote>Do we want to be so easily pushed around by fear? Or do we want to look at fear for what it is: a message that things are about to change.</blockquote><p>If we could collectively learn how to face fear in healthy ways, then we can have true freedom from fear, liberty and choice in our individual pursuits of happiness and survival. We can collectively grow and adapt to the new realities that our environment, time, and new technologies are imposing on us.</p><p>Because the truth is, when we choose to open our eyes, we have a lot of challenges ahead of us. We will need every ounce of our awareness to survive.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Global_Risks_2035_web_0922.pdf\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">[Link to list of upcoming environmental &amp; geopolitical challenges for 2035]</a></p><h4>The Light of Awareness</h4><p>And that’s where new intelligence comes in. Our biological minds are not capable of full and functional self-awareness. In fact, our biology and mind heavily edits most of our experiences in the form of <a href=\"https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18#.urg35x5wa\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">cognitive bias</a> because we simply can’t process everything that’s happening. The closest that we have to come to full awareness, equanimity and peace is in the hearts of monasteries.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4G2FsJZT2jhzGZRDmGLHoA.jpeg\"></div><figcaption>A monk participates in a monastery festival in <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f080f141ec39\" target=\"_blank\">Pemba Sherpa</a>’s hometown in Phaplu,&nbsp;Nepal</figcaption></figure><p>Monasteries are peaceful because they minimize temptation, create a sense of community, and cultivate awareness and calm. Monks literally spend 8 hours a day observing their own minds. It’s a full time job.</p><p>But when you look at it financially, everyone cannot be in a monastery. Monasteries are funded by society and survive on donations. They are a spiritual sanctuary that societies choose to invest in. Another aspect of our specialized human societies.</p><p>The only way to democratize peace is to create a way for all of us to have peace inside our own minds. <em>Customized Peace</em>. You can imagine that would be the last product to fly off shelves — because after that, we would all be so happy that we wouldn’t buy things anymore.</p><p>Peace will never take away pain, but we would no longer suffer from pain the way we used to. We would be happy with the clothes on our backs, the food in our bellies, and the relationships in our lives. Our lives would be occupied with learning and doing enough new things to keep our individual minds and bodies entertained and challenged, in a customized way, just for us.</p><p>We would be content riding the not-so-extreme roller coaster of each stage of our lives. Pain would come and then go. Pleasure would come and then go. We wouldn’t grasp for pleasure or fear pain.</p><p>We'd&nbsp;grow older, and no longer have the intense desire for new things, at which point we would become comfortable with the daily routines of our lives until our bodies are no longer able to sustain life itself, and then we'd pass away, peacefully.</p><p>In this way, we would all enjoy the present moment, with no desire for what we don’t have, and no fear of death or the unknown.</p><h4>The Virtue in&nbsp;Vice</h4><p>Now, isn’t that a strange picture. It’s oddly utopian, kind of nice, but kind of disconcerting. The drama of life is actually kind of exciting, spicy — oddly motivational. Why else would you do anything, if not because you wanted something or didn’t want something to happen? Who are we without our vices and our fears?</p><p>It’s almost hard to imagine life without fear or desire because it’s so fundamental to our human experience. Right down to our very first experiences during and after birth; an intense craving and gasping for air, crying from the shock of being squeezed head first through a dark and narrow birth canal into a cold and bright environment. Honestly, the thought of it is terrifying.</p><p>But also, it highlights why we need desire. If we didn’t crave for air, we wouldn’t breathe upon birth. If we didn’t crave for milk, we wouldn’t suckle at our mother’s breast. If we didn’t fear pain, we would leave our hand on the fire until we died from infection. If we didn’t suffer, we wouldn’t learn. Our environment dictates that we need desire and fear to survive.</p><p>But how can we survive our desire and our fear? I believe the answer is in the next step of our evolution through technology. We need to enhance our awareness in order to democratize joy and give freedom from needless suffering to as many people as we can.</p><blockquote>Our environment dictates that we need desire and fear to survive, but how can we survive our desire and our fear?</blockquote><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czgOWmtGVGs\" target=\"_blank\">12,016 years since humans first built buildings</a>, it took 10,000 years for Buddha to realize and spread the message in 500 BC that attachment to desire and fear was the root of suffering. 2,500 years after Buddha we are reaching another pivotal point in our cultural and human evolution, this time more heavily intertwined in co-evolution with our own technologies.</p><p>We need to foster compassion. We need to evolve. We need technology. Because without it, we will be lost to the desire and fear which allowed us to survive this far.

Reconnecting and reminiscing goes both ways, opening up lovely memories but also old wounds. Here’s an old Buddhist exercise for strengthening compassion during the holiday season, with a new technological spin.</p><h4>The “Difficult Person”&nbsp;Exercise</h4><p>A few days ago, I read an article on Lion’s Roar on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.lionsroar.com/trading-places/?goal=0_1988ee44b2-557671f2b6-22239101&amp;mc_cid=557671f2b6&amp;mc_eid=2a84244877&amp;utm_campaign=557671f2b6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_12_08&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Lion%27s%20Roar%20Newsletter&amp;utm_term=0_1988ee44b2-557671f2b6-22239101\" target=\"_blank\">how to deal with difficult people in your life</a>. It proposes a trading places exercise, with you and the difficult person (DP) sitting across from each other (in your imagination of course).</p><p>It’s a fully immersive reality and mind-bending exercise where you imagine being fully in the difficult person’s body, what does it feel like? What pains does he or she experience?</p><p>And then, imagine that you’re looking at yourself as the DP. What does you/DP want from you that you don’t want to give? Now, imagine that you give yourself/the DP what they want. How does it make them you/them feel?</p><p>Now shift back to yourself and your reality. Is that something that you can do? How can you reach a compromise? How can you make both people, yourself and the DP, feel happy, safe, and secure?</p><h4>Snapchat Already Does&nbsp;This</h4><p>The exercise reminds me of Snapchat’s Face Swap “filter” where you and a friend swap faces. Now, imagine that you are friendly with that special difficult person in your life, and you face swap on Snapchat! How strange that would be! (see Useful Links)</p><p>Face swapping in augmented reality (AR) is a particularly compelling case, because as you move your body and your face in real life (RL) the body and face of your friend or opponent moves in sync. This messes with the “agency” part of our minds, shifting over our sense of self to identify with your friend or opponent — which is quite a trippy experience.</p><h4>Using Augmented or Virtual Reality to Train Compassion</h4><p>In the future, I imagine AR (like face swapping) or fully immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences (wearing headsets) will be incredibly strong tools to trick our identities into shifting.</p><p>Imagine you’ve just put on a pair of VR goggles. You’re in a normal enough but unfamiliar home. You glance in the mirror and you see the face of your opponent, the “difficult person”. As you widen your eyes, the image widens it’s eyes. Soon it’s no longer an it, it’s you. You’ve become the difficult person in fully immersive virtual reality environment.</p><p>I can bet, that in a few short minutes, you’ll feel compassion and friendliness toward this person who has been causing you so much difficulty. And that’s the first step towards communication and problem solving.</p><h4>The Big Questions for Technologists</h4><p>How can we use AR and VR technologies to enhance communication and cooperation? In an increasingly globalized world, we have many cross-cultural conflicts.</p><blockquote><em>How can we use AR and VR technologies to enhance communication and cooperation?</em></blockquote><p>Imagine if you could wear a hijab while hearing bombs land on neighboring houses around you, hearing children cry for their parents. Just a few minutes of this experience is enough to jolt compassion into the hearts of wary politicians and hardened war generals.</p><p>But is that what we want? Netflix’s Black Mirror asks us this question in “Men Against Fire” where the military invented compassion-killing contact lenses that turn “the enemy” into frightening monsters that shriek like aliens from your worst nightmares. In the episode, this technology increased the kill rate from 10–20% like during World War II, when many soldiers would fire above the heads of opposing troops, to upwards of 90%.</p><p><strong>We have to ask ourselves if we want compassion.</strong>&nbsp;This is a choice, a trait that we can choose to enhance or weaken in ourselves as humans and technologies co-evolve.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHXpb9ggfEj\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*NRb60j8L-BRSZBug.\" alt=\"Olivia Jeffers with Compassionate Technologies on Instagram with a Hijab, Identity Shifting\"></div></a><figcaption>My own identity shifting exercise, I first wore hijabs in Muslim areas of Indonesia like Terengganu, a very uncomfortable experience at first which soon became&nbsp;normal.</figcaption></figure>","short-text":"Here’s an old Buddhist exercise for strengthening compassion during the holiday season, with a new technological spin.","cover-image":{"fileId":"5a944e17d8dead000191d128","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d128_vr%20compassion%20cropped.jpeg"},"slug":"how-to-deal-with-difficult-people-an-old-buddhist-exercise-with-a-technological-spin","writer":"5a944e17d8dead000191d087","focus":"5a944e17d8dead000191d0a1","series-2":"5a944e17d8dead000191cfee","updated-on":"2018-02-26T19:34:25.389Z","updated-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","created-on":"2016-12-31T17:33:35.245Z","created-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","published-on":"2018-02-26T18:39:29.495Z","published-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","witlingo-id":1024,"soundcloud-track-id":0,"_cid":"5a944e17d8dead000191cfd9","_id":"5a944e17d8dead000191d0aa"},{"_archived":true,"_draft":false,"date-published-online":"2016-12-11T22:25:00.000Z","sources-additional-links":"<h4><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/olivia.jeffers/posts/3414224525693?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=revue\" target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"external\">(OP) Regarding Syria and social&nbsp;media…</a></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/olivia.jeffers/posts/3414224525693\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Syria and social media… suffering is not attractive and Facebook is not the place to “make change” or incite action.

Her face shows contempt and disgust for those who are not helping in the way that she expects them too. Would you want to help someone who shows you disgust and contempt?</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, it’s sad that those in need, those who are the most scared aren’t able to communicate effectively, especially across cultural boundaries, to get the help that they need. Let’s talk a bit about those cultural boundaries in the context of emotional engineering.</p><h4>Emotional and Cultural Engineering</h4><p>You can liken emotions and culture to software — and since you can do software engineering, it makes sense that you can do emotional engineering. This is often called marketing.</p><p>Emotional engineering is the psychological manipulation of one person’s emotional state, while cultural engineeering is the manipulation of a large group or society’s emotional state and values through the use of large-scale advertising such as art and news.</p><p>Each subset of people on all scales (individual, family, and up to communities such as sports clubs, religions, and countries) has codes of conduct and expectations. Those rules extend to phsyical and emotional boundaries.</p><p>For example, Eastern and Asian cultures tend towards being collective, with diminished sense of individual self while Western cultures are the opposite.</p><h4>Codes of Conduct: Levels of Aggression</h4><p>Each culture has codes of conduct for levels of aggression. My personal culture is a mixture of Chinese and American values, and I know that Chinese will speak loudly and intensely. A jovial and friendly Chinese conversation often sounds like a shouting match to an American.</p><p>In Chinese culture, blasts of anger and aggression are okay. It is normal for bosses to shout at their employees on a tight deadline, or for girlfriends to hit their boyfriends out of frustration. Because just as quickly as the aggression comes, it goes.</p><p>On the other hand, in Western culture, especially the Danish <em>hygge</em>, any level of aggression will quickly get you excommunicated from the group. In this culture, it takes a long time for someone to build up to to expressing anger, and once it’s finally expressed — the relationship is often destroyed.</p><p>As a mixed person, I learned this lesson the hard way. The first time I got “excommunicated” I felt like I had instantly become invisible. Nobody would look at, speak to, or listen to me. I became a non-person and a “blame bucket” for the group’s frustration.</p><p>At first I was devastated and confused, I didn’t understand what I had done wrong. In only a few days, my sadness turned into anger and then hatred for how I was being treated. They became non-humans to me as well. My thoughts turned from regaining their acceptance towards harming them, hating them, and making them feel hurt like I had been.</p><p>For me this happened in a few short days, but I have been watching this play out on a larger scale since 2001 between popular American culture and Muslims.</p><h4>Codes of Conduct: How to Ask for&nbsp;Help</h4><p>Each culture also has codes of conduct on how to ask for help. In some cultures you won’t get help if you don’t ask for it — in others you will be seen as selfish and punished for asking, relying instead on demonstrating need and hoping that your social network will pick you up.</p><p>As a disclaimer, I am not very familiar with Middle Eastern value sets. On a scale from 1 to 10, I’d place myself on a 2 for understanding Middle Eastern values. I’d place most Americans at a 0.1 out of 10.</p><p>I’ve befriended and worked with a few Iranians and Tunisians. Off the cuff, they are the warmest most generous people to their friends and family. Having the trust and love of an Iranian will make your life full of warmth, love and care.</p><p>However, in my experience, warmth quickly turns to wrath when someone’s feelings get hurt or expectations aren’t met. The wrath of one of my former Iranian colleagues was unlike the anger of any culture I’d ever experienced. It scared me and shocked me to the core.</p><p>While I have never spoken to this person again, upon reflection and observation, I understand their behavior was from a place of hurt and perceived betrayal. I understand that in their culture, their behavior was warranted — but in my culture, their behavior was completely unacceptable.</p><h4>Shifting Codes of Conduct with Social&nbsp;Media</h4><p>What I’m seeing on social media is the attitude of “the rest of the world doesn’t hear us, so let’s shout louder!” Unfortunately, we do hear you. We just don’t want to listen anymore.</p><p>When I see “Syria is burning and nobody is doing anything to help” it doesn’t incite action for me. At first I felt concerned, and watched a video or two — and I came away feeling guilty and confused. Now when I see the word Syria in my newsfeed, I actually blur my eyes a bit and skip over it. I’m not in the mood for guilt and confusion.</p><p>Regarding compassion, how can Syrians get the help that they need? How can we communicate need and love across cultural boundaries? How can we communicate as humans, instead of as Syrians and Americans? How can we use new social media tools in effective ways?</p><h4>Being Constructive: What I’d Like to&nbsp;See…</h4><p>I would like to open a discussion and brainstorm more effective marketing campaigns for those in need. With a busy and educated populace, extreme emotional pulls don’t work anymore… simply because there is so much competition for emotional energy and attention.</p><p>I would like to see a video that respects my intelligence and emotional boundaries, and calls out to my feeling of brotherhood with all humans to help both sides of conflict achieve peace. I would like to be given several small but impactful options to choose from — that gives me enough information to even come up with my own solutions for helping (see below for an example).</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*j9lSQ_jZ0O89q5tx.\"></div><figcaption>An example of an effective behavior change campaign #smallstrongpositive</figcaption></figure><p>I would like to want to help.

Intimacy is What We're Really Missing","content":"<p>Eric Weinstein (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein\" target=\"_blank\">@EricRWeinstein</a>) made an interesting comment at The <a href=\"http://www.thefutureofpeople.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future of People</a> conference at MIT two weeks ago. “There are so many interesting people, I don’t know what to do with them! Where do I put them? It becomes a storage issue,” he said.</p><blockquote>“There are so many interesting people, I don’t know what to do with them! Where do I put them? It becomes a storage issue.”</blockquote><p>He’s referring to a post-scarcity world of social connections and to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/06/04/136723316/dont-believe-facebook-you-only-have-150-friends\" target=\"_blank\">Dunbar’s number</a>, which says that humans are only capable of handling 150 relationships. He posits an updated version, that the limitation might be more <a href=\"https://www.fullcontact.com/blog/maintaining-relationships/\" target=\"_blank\">modular</a>, such as 150 relationships per network and not in total.</p><p>Taking theory into the real world — and straight into the world of my everyday life, Weinstein says “I can drop into any city in the world, say ‘Hey! Who’s into what I’m into?’ And we can connect as if we’ve been friends for years simply because we’re hooked into the same network.”</p><p>This being the new status quo, how do we get the connection and intimacy that we need in a post-scarcity world?</p><h4>Living on the Sharing&nbsp;Economy</h4><p><strong>“There are no such things as strangers, only friends we haven’t met yet.”</strong> <strong>— William Butler Yeats</strong></p><p>Instantaneous and intense connections have been my bread and butter traveling the world under different labels such as <a href=\"https://nomadlist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">digital nomad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/31-signs-youre-a-third-culture-kid?utm_term=.bsKNENy3W#.caVkAk26X\" target=\"_blank\">third culture kid</a>, and global citizen.</p><p>I epitomize the sharing economy. Living out of my bags for over two years, I cat and dog sit on <a href=\"http://www.trustedhousesitters.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TrustedHousesitters</a>, sharing puppy and kitty love in exchange for free housing. I use Uber, Lyft, and AirBnb in Bangkok, Shanghai, Copenhagen and Boston. I go “shul shopping” dropping in on Sundays to whichever church, monastery, or mosque that is nearby and strikes my fancy.</p><p>But the truth is that, after experiencing so much variety the only thing I want is a few intimate relationships. Nothing makes me happier in the world than seeing my old friends. Nothing, not even an engaging intellectual conversation with a stranger or a passing affair, can replace <strong>shared history.</strong></p><h4>Globalized Childhood, Interstitial Life</h4><p><strong>Shared history </strong>even I don’t even have much of. My family bought into globalization earlier than most.</p><p>My father is American, my mother is Chinese. Half my family is scattered throughout the U.S. in Ohio, California, and Texas while the other half is scattered throughout mainland China in Wuhan, Ganzhou, and Guiyang. We moved often and before Facebook Messenger was around. I’m not in touch with any of my friends from childhood, and only a few friends from adolescence.</p><p>To my mother’s chagrin, the truth is that I feel more connected to and understood by strangers that I’ve met through common interests than I do to many of my family. I have more in common with just about any coder in Boston than I do with my cousins in China.</p><p>However, my mixed blood gives me a reason to stay in touch, love, and care for people I never would have otherwise. It gives me empathy and compassion for people very different from me.</p><blockquote>I live an interstitial, global life. Belonging everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The life I live everyday will soon become the future for many.</blockquote><p>I see more interracial, international couples today, meeting at universities and international companies in large cities around the world. Our world is mixing, and travel is becoming so cheap and convenient that the lifestyle I was born into without choice, will be available and accessible to everyone on a whim.</p><p>Those who dreamed of leaving their hometowns and getting away can travel endlessly. And they already are. Trading the stability I never had for the excitement, novelty, and exploration that I was born into.</p><h4>Dreaming of the Impossible, A Dunbar’s Village Just For&nbsp;Me…</h4><p>When I find myself dreaming of what’s impossible, I dream of true intimacy and stability. I dream of all my friends from all over the world together in one place. I wish that I could have a village with all my friends just for me. And they could have a village with all their friends just for them. That we could all have our different, stable, heart-warming realities that make us feel safe, secure, and needed.</p><blockquote>I wish that I could have a village with all my friends just for me. And they could have a village with all their friends just for them.</blockquote><p>I know that it would be impossible in our current world. If my friends from Nepal, Thailand, California, Seattle, Boston, Berlin, New York, Shanghai, Australia, and Washington DC were to live in one place — they would lose all their friends in their homes in their networks.</p><p>The technologies of virtual and augmented realities might make my dreams remotely possible #pardonthepun.</p><p><strong>If I could see my friends faces, laugh and share jokes, share a meal and a glass of wine with them from across the world. I can’t tell you how happy I would be.</strong></p><h4>Using Technology to fill the #IntimacyVoid</h4><p>My ultimate dream technology would be <strong>teleportation</strong>, warping the fabric of space and time so that I could actually share a hug, adventure or intimate moments with those I love. I don’t want to layer emotions on top of a robot trying to mimic those that I love. At that point, I’d rather just be in the Matrix, if I’m not already.</p><blockquote>But we don’t have any of that yet, so I settle for seeing them once a year, sometimes once every few years. Sometimes once in a lifetime, only in touch by Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, or WeChat. I miss them.</blockquote><p>So while yes, there is certainly no scarcity in the world for interesting people, in my world as a digital nomad and global citizen, there is a scarcity of intimacy and shared connection.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Thanks from Olivia&nbsp;:)</h4><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BN2qNzBDYIu/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=revue\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*a0JJjkxxfJEwBftg.\"></div></a><figcaption>The future is a blank slate?

Vipassana means to “to see things as they really are.”</em></p><p><em>(9 months ago)&nbsp;</em>After working for a tech company for 6 months, and completing a 10-day Vipassana meditation, I had many thoughts about technology and how it affects our lives and our futures.</p><p>First, let me explain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhamma.org/en/about/vipassana\" target=\"_blank\">the concept of Vipassana</a>. The word itself means “to see things as they really are.” The meditation is for 10 days in silence, with 10 hours a day of meditation, with no eye contact or writing. In true silence, I was left with only observing my deepest thoughts and subtlest experiences.</p><p>After 100 hours of meditation on my own mind and body, I have one large question:&nbsp;<strong>how can we develop technology that is healthy for our minds and bodies?</strong></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>First, what is&nbsp;healthy?</h4><p>I observed that I had a lot of anxiety and attachment to my social media accounts. Did my Instagram get enough likes? Is anyone reading my Facebook posts? Even during the retreat, I was crafting new blog posts in my mind or thinking about which pictures to post to Instagram. These thoughts were in my subconscious, and very unpleasant to experience.</p><p>A new trend tells me that I’m not alone in this experience. Last November, a young Instagram star “<a href=\"http://www.today.com/news/instagram-star-quits-social-media-reveals-her-dream-life-was-t53721\" target=\"_blank\">quit social media</a>” revealing that her “dream life was a sham” and how psychologically damaging it was for her. In the end, in her video, she is pleading for people in tech to “make an app that is not based on social approval, that’s based on quality. I’ll promote, I’ll use it, and I think people will really love it.”</p><p>It took a very deep silence for me to realize just how obsessed and attached I was to social media — and I’m not even that active on social media, and I only started using it in my late teens. It makes me wonder, how strong is the attachment and obsession in people who have been using social media since they were young? How are children and teenagers’ minds being affected?</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>Second, what is the nature of&nbsp;mind?</h4><p>I realized that my mind is LOUD. And uncontrolled, and sometimes violent and aggressive — and bossy, and abusive, and simply exhausting.</p><p>Anyone who has sat down in silence and found themselves uncomfortably bored has this experience. And the constant use of technology means that we are never bored, we are never in silence, and our minds are always active — from when we wake up to when we go to sleep. Our mind is king.</p><p>In this interesting blog post from Melting Asphalt called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/\" target=\"_blank\">Neurons Gone Wild</a>, it posits that the mind is a group of autonomously “selfish” neurons. So sometimes one group of neurons can actually work against the benefit of the whole — like an aggressive tyranny or a harsh dictatorship.</p><p>From Vipassana, I discovered that even my most subtle thoughts I can&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;in my body. This gave me a huge insight, because the reverse is also true: every sensation in my body is connected to a thought.&nbsp;<strong>Which brings the question, just how separate are the mind and body?</strong></p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>So what’s the matter with how we create&nbsp;now?</h4><p>In the tech field, we create products that people enjoy using. In order to make money, we create products that people crave using. In general, we generate a feeling of addiction, by attaching user’s core identity and feelings of self worth to numbers.</p><p>And we do it all subconsciously.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mind-development.eu/architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\">The human mind is only capable of holding on average 7 items in working memory</a>. This means that we are only aware of around 7 thoughts — with all the rest of the thinking (managing heart rate, respiration, emotional responses to facial expressions, reactions to subtle app designs) are underneath our conscious awareness.</p><p>Arguably, the most successful advertisers, marketers, or designers understand that most judgments and decisions are made subconsciously — and that most people are pretty much the same under the hood — so they can manipulate responses in a predictable manner to sell a product or create a feeling of craving and addiction for a certain product.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>How can we create healthy and profitable products?</h4><p>In my job as a UX Designer and Product Manager, I have to use my empathy and understanding of how the mind works to create enjoyable apps to engage and keep users.

It’s easy to get sucked in and forget that my suffering and viewpoints are not the only suffering and viewpoints out there.<br></p><p>Smartphones, social media, constant notifications and even upcoming augmented and virtual reality technologies create walls between our minds and the world. The human mind in it’s natural state is already&nbsp;<a href=\"https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18?gi=f1c105881c47\" target=\"_blank\">programmed for bias</a>&nbsp;and bending reality. New technologies only make it easier to remain deaf and blind to the suffering of others.</p><p>It’s easy to blame technology, and it’s important to make a distinction between our use of technology and the technology itself. Take a look at your hands right now — those are two beautifully designed pieces of technology. What you do with your hands is up to you.</p><h4>Looking Inside Ourselves</h4><h5><strong>Opening Our Eyes and Hearts to Compassion</strong></h5><p>This year America looked inside herself, and what we saw wasn’t pretty or kind. Our eyes were peeled open to the suffering of black Americans with the #BlackLivesMatter movement. And this week, our eyes were torn open again to the suffering of disenfranchised white and other voiceless Americans.</p><p>The feelings of middle America have been a complete surprise and shock for many. I’ve seen protests and tears in the cities, liberals and foreigners trembling with the feelings of fear and powerlessness. It’s not just middle America that voted for Trump, but there are “silent supporters” off the blogosphere such as this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/11/10/im-a-muslim-a-woman-and-an-immigrant-i-voted-for-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Muslim woman</a>&nbsp;and immigrant who recently wrote about why she supports Trump.</p><p>The United States is a beautiful painting of contradictions, like almost all people and places are. As a nation, we have been particularly repressed, locked behind pearly white smiles and political correctness, where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-rise-of-all-purpose-antidepressants/\" target=\"_blank\">10% of Americans are on antidepressants</a>&nbsp;and racial bias is blatantly obvious but not spoken of.</p><p>For or against Trump, this election year has been a painful but a wonderful opportunity for us to begin the process of feeling compassion for everyone in this country.</p><h4>The Good, The Bad, and&nbsp;Reality</h4><h5><strong>Taking Away the Labels</strong></h5><p>We’ve become a bit obsessed with labels. Liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, Communist or Democratic, Christian or Muslim, Sunni or Shia, black or white, good or bad. This makes sense for a binary “us vs. them” worldview.</p><p>Now more than ever, with globalization and the rapid advent of many humanity-changing technologies, life is colored far outside the lines of easy labels.</p><p>Let’s take a look at charity and compassion, for example. Not giving as much to charity is highly correlated with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/\" target=\"_blank\">wealth</a>. African Americans statistically give&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-blacks-donors-idUSTRE81M1WI20120223\" target=\"_blank\">more of their income to charity</a>. Is this trait correlated with the wealth gap? And does it have to be?</p><p>Is one way of life more good or bad? Sometimes being selfish brings joy and harmony, sometimes it brings suffering and discord. Sometimes being charitable brings joy and harmony, sometimes it brings suffering discord.</p><p>Some of you might ask, how can being charitable be harmful? In the classic example, if you’re exhausted yet agree to give your time to someone, it’s easy to become resentful, harming the relationship in the long run and yourself in the short term.</p><h4>The SMR Echo&nbsp;Palace</h4><h5><strong>Social Media Reality &amp; Technology-Induced Busyness</strong></h5><p>Navigating this world of unlabeled gray requires openness, awareness, and flexibility. It’s not about behaving rightly, but behaving smartly and effectively. Knowing when it’s time to be selfish, time to be charitable, time to love, time to set kind boundaries, time to protect, or time to sacrifice. Flexibility and openness, however, are not usually associated with technological development or innovation.</p><p>Technology has historically liked labels and lines, it makes it easier to put things into a structured, relational database which has powered our business logic engines for the last 50 years. Only in the last handful of years have unstructured or NoSQL databases become widely used (<a href=\"http://blog.outsourcing-partners.com/2012/10/why-nosql-database-is-used-by-facebook-google-and-linkedin-applications/\" target=\"_blank\">Cassandra used by Facebook</a>&nbsp;for example). Even still, these databases rely on labeling, although not as rigidly.</p><p>My personal piece of technology, my iPhone, makes me feel busy and a little bit elite. It’s constantly buzzing and popping with updates, sending my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/generation-notification-science-behind-notifications-obsessed/866812/\" target=\"_blank\">dopamine system</a>&nbsp;into a high but never satisfied overdrive. Not only does it make me feel busy and important, it knows me almost better than I know myself, sending my labels out to apps who send back customized information just for me, creating my own personal Echo Palace. A place where I’m Queen and everything is catered and customized to my every Like or Comment.</p><p>It’s SMR, Social Media Reality which can be just as mind-bending as wearing a VR headset.</p><h4>The Big Questions for Technologists</h4><h5><strong>Growing and Nurturing the Heart Muscle</strong></h5><p>How can we use technology to increase our flexibility and awareness, so that we can choose our actions more deliberately in the confusing and challenging gray areas of reality? How can we do this and make money at the same time? After all, an enlightened and aware populace might not buy as much!</p><p>How can we use technology so that economic incentives line up with increasing joy and minimizing suffering? The use of blockchain is already changing how we trust financial institutions. Maybe in the future, our most basic concepts of money and finance will change as well.</p><p>Technology is an extension of our culture and our bodies. In a way, without knowing it, we have always been gods building ourselves. It’s inevitable that we will continue to shape ourselves. Every decision, every design, every click shapes the future.</p><p>My goal with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.compassionate-technologies.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Compassionate Technologies</a>&nbsp;is to create a framework for building flexibility and awareness into ourselves. Brainstorming how we can design technologies, companies, and investment communities which thrive not only on business but&nbsp;<strong>compassion KPIs</strong>.</p><p>In an increasingly flexible and globalized world, I hope that we can find ways for compassion, technology, and business to advance together.</p><h4>Thanks from Olivia&nbsp;:)</h4><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMb0AjjD_Ha\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*g4DeksuEAieFdl-j.\" alt=\"\"></div></a><figcaption>Thanks for reading!

For big data, you need at least an Olympic-size swimming pool — if not an entire ocean to dive into (I guess that would <a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/03/small-data-specialized-deep-learning-yann-lecun.html\" target=\"_blank\">deep learning</a>).</p><p>See below for size, scale, and applications of different types of deep learning algorithms. Whispers in the wind, I’ve heard that advances are being made in applied small data, which would be great for the rest of us &lt;1 PB data folks!</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*X5Of2-He3_oNHDd-.\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>III. Why Big Ol' Enterprise Companies Still Can't Spin It Up</h4><p>So now big data is the new trend that every enterprise company is trying to jump on and tech startups are trying to get into.</p><p><strong>The only paying customers though, are enterprise companies</strong>, because they are the only ones with enough data. They’re the only ones with Olympic-size swimming pools in their basements. Anybody else has only bathtubs or jacuzzis.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andyhpalmer\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Palmer</a> with <a href=\"http://www.tamr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tamr</a> and Kalyan Veeramachaneni with MIT and <a href=\"http://www.feature-labs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FeatureLabs</a>, <strong>the problem with big data is more cultural and strategic rather than technical.</strong></p><p>In order to use big data, machine learning, or predictive models effectively you have to start with a strategic business question, says Kalyan. That question comes from executive leadership, which for large enterprise companies, can take months to get everyone on the same page.</p><p>Once the question is formulated, it gets translated into tech speak by data scientists and executed by engineers. But scientists can’t work with dirty data. Imagine asking a librarian a question and instead of the Dewey Decimal System, the library just has piles of books on the floor. Good luck getting an answer, even from the smartest librarian.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>IV. Cleaning Up Dirty Data — No ML&nbsp;Required</h4><p>One of the large barriers for enterprise companies, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taoawu\" target=\"_blank\">Tao Wu</a>, Principal Data Scientist at Microsoft, is that they often have “<strong>legacy constraints in their way</strong>” and the culture isn’t aligned to value or use data effectively.</p><p>A lot of value can be extracted from simple data cleaning.</p><blockquote>Large enterprise companies don’t need AI rockstars, says Andy, they need a company culture with basic awareness of statistics and data.</blockquote><p>He recounts a project where a company was about to spend $5 million on a national advertising campaign. After running the target list against the national registry of deceased persons, they found that over 40% were dead. That would have been a $2 million loss for that company.</p><p>Even for companies that traditionally rely on logistics and data and who achieved enterprise status pre-2010, like General Electric, their databases or company structures were likely not designed with big data in mind.</p><p>Andy recounts a project with GE, which was founded in 1892 and is currently working to establish themselves as the “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TechCompassion/status/780130794329235457\" target=\"_blank\">epicenter of the industrial internet</a>” in Boston. In the process of adapting, they discovered that they had 3–4x fewer suppliers than they thought they had, leading to inaccurate resource allocation and a loss of millions of dollars.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>V. Data in the Global&nbsp;Market</h4><p>The apples hang low in the trillion dollar international telcom industry. “Simple revenue optimization in telcos is a big problem,” Andy says, regarding work done with Huawei, a large Chinese telecommunication company which overtook Ericcson in 2012.</p><p>If Huawei is hoping to move past simple revenue optimization, the success of future data solutions will depend on whether the “strategic intention [to implement data solutions is] going through the entire organization” says Tao.</p><p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/06/huaweis-culture-is-the-key-to-its-success\" target=\"_blank\">Known for their customer-first culture</a>, Huawei has achieved enormous success, but what about their data culture? With cell phones becoming a commodity and not much left in the way of design advantages, the next big plays in international telecommunications might be in data, <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2016/08/25/china-telecom-five-year-plan-iot-pl4/\" target=\"_blank\">if it isn’t already</a>.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>VI. Changing the Culture of&nbsp;Data</h4><p>Kalyan is working on a startup which is aimed toward making machine learning solutions easily accessible to enterprise companies. The big question, he says, is “<strong>how do you form a question?</strong>”</p><p>Like we talked about earlier, there’s a <strong>data pipeline</strong>, taking questions from the strategic executive level down to engineers, and back up again in the form of answers or Oracle-like predictions.</p><p><strong>Predictive models</strong> are hot stuff in the data world — after all, being able to accurately predict supply and demand means more profit and less cost.</p><blockquote>However, “like bills making it to the Congressional floor, 99.9% of predictive models never make it to use,” Kalyan says.</blockquote><p>His startup <a href=\"http://www.feature-labs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FeatureLabs</a> aims to make rapid prototyping of predictive models accessible to enterprise customers. With a solid understanding of enterprise culture, I’m excited to see where this company goes in the next several years.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>VII. The Big Questions for Technologists</h4><p>Many of us are afraid that our jobs will be eaten by robots or that we’ll be insidiously replaced by an awoken and grumpy Internet. While that might happen, it’s important to take a clear look at the state of data and how it’s being used in business.</p><blockquote>Our jobs are safe, for now. Enterprise companies still don’t know what they’re doing for the most part, and the largest problems are cultural and not technical.</blockquote><p>There’s room for us to grow and adapt and still time to shape the future for a more human-friendly datasphere.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" data-rt-max-width=\"80px\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" style=\"max-width: 80px;\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d13f_scribble.png\"></div></figure><h4>Thanks from Olivia&nbsp;:)</h4><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\" class=\"w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 60%;\"><a target=\"_blank\" data-rt-link-type=\"ext-link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMu_SjOjLK9\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*QIQsv0VPrN4xa6Ml.\" alt=\"\"></div></a><figcaption>Data can be abstract and too in the cloud (pardon the pun)... so here’s a #throwback to earlier earthier&nbsp;times.</figcaption></figure>","short-text":"Ever wonder how big is big data?

Einstein’s\ntheory of gravity, known as “general relativity,” works\nremarkably well for describing the motion of galaxies, black holes, and other\ncelestial bodies, while quantum mechanics works remarkably well for describing\nthe behavior of protons, electrons, and other small objects.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, general relativity and quantum mechanics\nare actually incompatible—neither one can accurately describe\nall physical processes.&nbsp; This\nincompatibility has led physicists on a quest for a theory of “quantum\ngravity” that successfully combines both aspects of Einstein’s\nwork.&nbsp; In the last few decades,\nstring theory has emerged as the leading candidate for such a theory.</p><h4>Enter String Theory</h4><p>String theory offers a number of famously bizarre postulates\nabout our universe: everything we see is made up of tiny, vibrating strings;\nthere are actually nine dimensions of space (not three), but the other six are\ncurled up so small we cannot see them.&nbsp;\nFrom this string theory has earned an aura of intrigue in popular\nculture, featuring notably in the hit television show “The Big Bang\nTheory.”</p><p>However, string theory has earned its share of critics, too.&nbsp; The energies required to test string\ntheory are far larger than experimentalists can produce at particle colliders,\nso there is no direct experimental evidence for string theory and probably none\nforthcoming.&nbsp; This lack of\nexperimental evidence has led many to ask, “Is string theory\nreally science?”&nbsp;</p><h4>Experimentation vs. Theory</h4><p>The answer to this question ultimately depends on how one defines\n“science.”&nbsp; Is\nscience a process by which experiments are used to falsify theoretical\npredictions, or is science a synonym for rational human thought?&nbsp; The verificationist movement of the\nfirst half of the 20th century essentially attempted to equate these two\ndefinitions, but most contemporary philosophers realize that such a program is\nhopeless: a large fraction of our beliefs cannot be verified solely using the\nfive senses.&nbsp; String theory may not\nbe capable of experimental verification, but that does necessarily mean it runs\ncounter to rational thought.</p><p>In a field like medicine, experiment is crucial because the human\nanatomy is far too complex to be understood purely as a mathematical\nstructure.&nbsp; But the fundamental\nlaws of particle physics, on the other hand, are tightly constrained by\nmathematics alone.&nbsp; For instance,\nthe theoretical arguments supporting the existence of the Higgs boson were so\nstrong that the particle was considered part of the “standard model” of\nparticle physics for decades before its inevitable discovery in 2012.&nbsp; The situation for string theory today\nis not so very different.</p><p>In just\nthe past couple of months, two independent collaborations (<a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04253.pdf\">Strings from Massive Spins</a> &amp; <a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCPTcRSFb5k\">Massless Particle Dynamics</a>)&nbsp;have proven mathematically under certain assumptions that <em>any </em>consistent\ntheory of quantum gravity must be a string theory (using a precise, technical\ndefinition of a “string theory”).</p><p>There are a few caveats here, and it is\nnot yet clear how many mathematically consistent string theories might exist in\naddition to the ones we already know and love.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the evidence is quickly mounting that when it\ncomes to theories of quantum gravity, string theory is the only game in\ntown.&nbsp; It is not far-fetched to\nimagine that in our lifetimes, physicists could prove string theory\nmathematically—no experiments needed.</p><blockquote>the evidence is quickly mounting that when it comes to theories of quantum gravity, string theory is the only game in town</blockquote><p>A back-and-forth between theory and experiment is wonderful to\nhave, but sometimes theory by itself is sufficient (and it is far, far less\nexpensive).&nbsp;

In fact, the pivot is even more radical than that: in a nutshell, the call is to no longer buy and own things, but instead, to borrow stuff for a fee – i.e., to rent — and to rent them for exactly as long as you need them. We have gone from purchasing and owning stuff to paying for services on demand.</p><h4>Invisible Apps</h4><p>But ironically, this ethos of The Sharing Economy is emerging in parallel with the occurrence of another no less monumental development: the rise of the <a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/\">Zero Marginal cost society</a>. Just when manufacturing things is cheaper than it has ever been (thanks to automation across the value chain and a production stack culminating in the 3D printer), the capitalist model is rapidly morphing from one of selling things to one of selling services. But this seeming paradox is not a conundrum because there is no longer any profit left in making things, economic activity is now moving to the service layer, where vast swaths of space and opportunity have opened up. Since service is all about experience, the race is now fiercely on for who can deliver value with minimal imposition on the customer.</p><blockquote>Since service is all about experience, the race is now fiercely on for who can deliver value with minimal imposition on the customer.</blockquote><p>Today, we are witnessing the “sudden” emergence of a whole new kind of interface: “Invisible Apps.” These “Invisible Apps” leverage a whole ecosystem of technologies that are now becoming affordable and available for developers and entrepreneurs to build with. Only five years ago they were locked up in private labs.</p><h4>Formerly Cutting-Edge, Entering Mainstream</h4><p>The list includes: highly accurate Speech Recognition, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation, Texting platforms, etc. The emerging and evolving result is the enthralling birth of a whole new generation of minimalist apps and products that aim to do the human’s bidding quickly, efficiently, and then humbly getting out of the way once done.</p><p> A few clicks gets you a taxi (Uber, Lyft), fewer clicks get you a pizza (Dominos); for taking care of your health you have Vida; to quickly find a restaurant, use Luka.ai; to book a trip with no hassle, there’s Pana; for your booze there’s Saucey, and the long list goes on.</p><h4><strong>Best In Class: Amazon Echo</strong></h4><p>The one product that best epitomizes the shift in making technology bend to serve us humans, rather than the humans literally mutilating themselves (ruining their posture, their vision, their social face-to-face connectivity with fellow humans) just so that they can extract value from technology, is the Amazon Echo. Unlike the imperialist Visual-Touch smart phone that demands submission without apology, the Amazon Echo respects the human action flow and is the best invisible, interactive/interactional product available in the market today.</p><p>If you want to know something quickly, just naturally speak your question, then listen for the answer — and move on. If you want music, just say the name of a song and it starts playing. You don’t have to take your eyes off whatever you are looking at (your laptop screen, your book, the dishes you were washing), nor would you have to take your hands off wherever you had them (your laptop keyboard, your book, the dishes your were washing).</p><p>It is a satisfying irony that the most compelling mainstream use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) today is moving towards respecting the basic proposition that whatever products and solutions such AI delivers, the interface needs to respect the sanctity of the human action flow by bending the machine to understand the human in her own language.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Whatever products and solutions such AI delivers, the interface needs to respect the sanctity of the human action flow by bending the machine to understand the human in her own language.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The hope is that this ethos of subsuming the machine to the human (and, crucially, understanding that the delivery of such value cannot defeat its own purpose by mangling the human in the process) will inform the other emerging uses of Artificial Intelligence. The means should never be allowed to destroy the end in the name of justifying that end.</p>","cover-image-attributions":"<p>https://www.ipglab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Amazon-Echo-Kitchen-940x529.png</p>","short-text":"A new wave of innovation is sweeping modern society and its ethos can be summed up in two words: cutting waste.

That’s only a small tidbit of what those animals have to endure on a daily basis.</li><li>&nbsp;It helps them grow faster and more importantly, fatter. Quite profitable characteristics in the eyes of a farmer. Antibiotics in the meat industry keep corporations like Tyson and Purdue selling cheap meat. Good for your wallet, but bad for your health!</li></ol><p>So we now know why antibiotics are being fed to animals. But what exactly are the consequences to doing so? They are essentially creating antibiotic resistant bacteria.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Humans and animals alike have a set of microbes in our gut. Some good and some bad. When we don’t need to take antibiotics, but do anyway, this eliminates all microbes.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Even the ones we want! If there happens to be a microbe in our gut that is resistant because of mutated DNA, it is able to continue thriving, reproducing, and eventually spread to other guts.&nbsp;<a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://youtu.be/4KMWun3Og8I\">Check out this video about antibiotic resistant microbes from the perspective of a factory farmed pig</a></p><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.2061%; width: 100%; max-width: 100%;\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" data-rt-max-height=\"56.206088992974244%\" data-page-url=\"https://youtu.be/4KMWun3Og8I\" data-rt-type=\"video\" data-rt-dimensions=\"854:480\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KMWun3Og8I\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>&nbsp;</figure><p>How does one avoid this mess?

That hasn't stopped scientists and venture capitalists from betting on who will win. Business is moving fast with licenses being sold, awaiting the USPTO's decision in November which may declare a winner on the patent.<br></p><p>When it comes to pharmaceuticals, patents are licensed and traded in the amount of millions of dollars funneled through a 14 to 20-year timer.</p><p>While the stakes are high, CRISPR/Cas9 is not the only gene editing technology out there. It was however, the first gene editing technology to be discovered in ancient bacteria, channeling new interest with the hope to discover an unclaimed and more effective gene editing technique.</p><h4>Who's Who in the CRISPR Patent Brawl</h4><p>There are over 20 patents for various aspects of CRISPR technology, the patents are claimed and divvied up between four major companies: Editas with Zhang and MIT (public company, raised $190M), Caribou with Doudna and UC Berkeley (private, ~$42M), Intellia (public, $104M), and CRISPR Therapeutics with Charpentier (private, $154M).</p><p>While Doudna and Charpentier are largely touted as first to invent the technology, Zhang was first to file, with MIT paying extra fees for expedited filing services. Filed at the cusp between \"first to invent\" and \"first to file\" the patents hang in limbo until the next USPTO hearing in November.</p><p>At the heart of the dispute is the claim that Doudna only applied the patent for bacterial cells - and not for human cells, which are more complicated versions of bacterial cells. The dispute over what is and isn't obvious, along with timing of filing and evidence of first to discover, could point the patent, and millions of dollars of royalties, to either Doudna or Zhang.</p><h4>Gene Therapeutics: Not Yet Approved, So What Now?</h4><p>Pharmaceutical companies make money in two ways: drug sales and royalties on intellectual property. Since gene therapeutics are so new and governments haven't yet decided how to regulate the therapies, there are currently no sales in the U.S. and will likely be no sales for several years. So how do companies based off of CRISPR/Cas9 attract investment and operate?</p><p>Investors are betting that gene therapeutics will be profitable, and patents for CRISPR/Cas9 are held until 2033. Usually companies receive single-digit percentage royalties as well as yearly licensing fees on the scale of several hundred thousand dollars. If Editas wins the license, they can passively collect revenue on any drug sales from therapeutics using the Cas9 technology.</p><p>These pre-revenue companies also do collaboration with other large pharmaceuticals. Competing in the growing cancer space with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, Editas partnered with Juno Therapeutics receiving an upfront payment of $25M, while Intellia (founded by Caribou) has engaged in a collaboration with Novartis receiving an upfront payment of $10M. Entering the field of inborn metabolic disorders Intellia collaborated with Regeneron in April, receiving $75M upfront.</p><h4>But Is CRISPR/Cas9 Actually That Big of a Deal?</h4><p>While there is a Nobel prize floating around, and upfront license payments and collaborations are over $100M with billions to be gained in the coming 18 years, it also might not be that big of a deal in everyday research.</p><p>Zhang recently discovered another method in the CRISPR system called Cpf1, which staggers the DNA break and only needs one guide RNA. While the discovery is not revolutionary scientifically, being just one of many in the CRISPR system, and with many others bound to be discovered in the coming years, it does however provide an answer to the patent brawl by simply stepping out of it. Cpf1 can do the same thing, without all the legal hassle. And there's more where it came from.</p><p>How does all this affect day-to-day science? Speaking with Alex Chavez with the Church Lab, who is researching modified CRISPR/Cas9 systems to treat Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), I ask if the CRISPR patent brawl will affect scientists' choice in research. Luckily he responded, \"I think a lot of people are driven purely by intellectual curiosity, and if [money] comes along, that's great.\"</p>","tag":"Genetic Engineering","short-text":"Is CRISPR/Cas9 actually that big of a deal?

The expression of your genetic code is regulated by epigenetics.</p><p>Epigenetics alters a cell’s identity through interacting with the environment. Recent evidence suggests our environment may not only affect us, but our offspring as well. In this way, Lamarckian evolution does not just bridge the divide between nature and nurture, but unites us and our ancestors as well.</p><h4>Lamarckian Evolution vs. Darwinian Evolution</h4><p>While Darwin has stolen the spotlight for many years, Lamarck held a somewhat different theory of evolution. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French soldier and naturalist who laid the foundations of modern zoology. He thought there existed an inheritance of acquired characteristics, for example that the giraffe arose from horses as they stretched their necks to reach tall branches; whereas Darwin theorized that genetic changes only occurred through random genetic mutations. Though Lamarckism has been replaced with genetic inheritance and Darwinism, the idea that traits acquired during an organism's lifetime may be passed down is still possible through the discovery of epigenetics. <a href=\"http://www.evolutionnews.org/2015/08/epigenetic_chan098671.html\">[2]</a></p><h4>The Science of Epigenetics</h4><p>Epigenetics describes changes in gene expression by altering how your DNA is packaged, not what it is composed of.</p><p>Each one of your thirty trillion cells must each store approximately seven feet of DNA into a cellular nucleus 600 times smaller than a fine grain of sand. To achieve this, DNA is spooled around proteins called histones that organize DNA into progressively more complex superstructures, from nucleosomes to chromatin and the familiar forty six chromosomes most of us possess. Altering how the DNA thread adheres to these histone spools will change chromosome structure and in turn, function. <a href=\"https://www.dnalc.org/resources/3d/07-how-dna-is-packaged-basic.html\">[3]</a> (see Additional Sources below)</p><p>DNA packaging is modified by tightening or loosening the chromatin. Loosening DNA coiling allows protein synthesis machinery to access the genes, tightening DNA restricts this access and effectively turns the gene off. This process is governed by the addition or subtraction of specific molecules onto either the histone or the DNA. Generally, adding a molecule loosens a region of the coil. These molecules are added through an interaction with the cell’s environment and passed down through cell lines, enabling Lamarckian evolution. </p><h4>From Father to Son: Inheriting Fear</h4><p>Can we inherit memories? In 2014, Brian Dias and Kerry Ressler conducted an experiment to test this. They exposed male mice to an aromatic compound (acetophenone, which smells like cherries or almonds) whose receptor gene (Olfr151) had been sequenced. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3594.epdf?referrer_access_token=DBxbVUuhkR21Y7VAQIqUwdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MLhU4y4LZkONbbyIJwg8aP3pmxG-tK_0mHAg_w5vfGn2GvEJ1Kqv4g-naMg76YpU35gHkFfgFdr6eAa_r7L556KpLdFCg7gv221DJLIPjJiBiTwHye3tNEXkq4WY1LHD-dO5I7M17U36U6rch2F6WxJ9Eaf5NxoXqIwYJRRGZ8yA%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.nature.com\">[4]</a> This was followed by a non-lethal electric shock. This is pavlovian fear conditioning: instead of dogs drooling, you have rats cowering. They then took these scared mice and bred them with healthy, unconditioned females. They took the male offspring and subjected them to the same conditioning as the father. </p><p>What they found was that children of the conditioned father were more easily scared of acetophenone than any other smell. When they checked the mouse brain they found overexpression of the Olfr151 receptor, the protein required to smell acetophenone. Finally, though they found no genetic variation between litter mates, the authors found epigenetic changes in the Olfr151 gene of extra fearful siblings. It was less tightly coiled. They repeated all the above steps, looking at the grand and great grand children of the original mouse but the results did not change. The conclusion was hard to deny; memories are inheritable and over multiple generations.</p><p>The mice were not born with a blank slate. The shadow of their father’s experience was cast over them. In humans, we have characterised this effect in families struck by famine, war and disease. Our ancestor’s tales are part of us. Not spiritually, but epigenetically in the spools of our DNA. Who our parents were is more a part of us then we could know. Epigenetics is then the bridge between nature and nurture. A resolution of Lamarck and Darwin and very likely the future of personalized medicine. </p><h4>Up Next Week: Technology in Genetic Engineering</h4><p>Scientists use CRISPR/Cas9 to alter epigenetics in therapeutic applications, with the ability to turn specific genes on and off.</p>","short-text":"Can we inherit memories?

The process starts with assembly of a nucleosome, which is formed when eight separate histone protein subunits attach to the DNA molecule. The combined tight loop of DNA and protein is the nucleosome. Six nucleosomes are coiled together and these then stack on top of each other. The end result is a fiber of packed nucleosomes known as chromatin. This structure, is then looped and further packaged using other proteins (which are not shown here) to give the final \"chromosomal\" shapes. It is this remarkable multiple folding which allows six feet of DNA to fit into the nucleus of each cell in our body. And a typical cell nucleus is so small that ten thousand could fit on the tip of a needle. It is important to realize that chromosomes are not always present, they form only when cells are dividing. At other times, as we can see here at the end of cell division, our DNA becomes less highly organized.”</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/fearful-memories-haunt-mouse-descendants-1.14272\">Fearful memories haunt mouse descendants</a> (2013, Nature, Ewen Callaway)</p><p><em>“</em><em>Genetic imprint from traumatic experiences carries through at least two generations.”</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41239/title/Epigenetics-Paper-Raises-Questions/\">Epigenetics Paper Raises Questions</a> (2014, The Scientist, Kate Yandall)</p><p><em>“GENETICS publishes a commentary criticizing a Nature Neuroscience paper claiming that mice can inherit smell sensitivities that their parents acquired during life.”</em></p>","slug":"research-in-genetic-engineering","writer":"5a944e17d8dead000191d085","series-2":"5a944e17d8dead000191cf72","updated-on":"2018-02-26T19:34:26.652Z","updated-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","created-on":"2016-07-24T20:04:33.109Z","created-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","published-on":"2018-02-26T18:39:29.495Z","published-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","cover-image":{"fileId":"5a944e17d8dead000191d0f3","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d0f3_micecover.png"},"soundcloud-track-id":276142745,"focus":"5a944e17d8dead000191d058","tags":["5a944e17d8dead000191d08e","5a944e17d8dead000191d09c","5a944e17d8dead000191d09d"],"published-online":true,"_cid":"5a944e17d8dead000191cfd9","_id":"5a944e17d8dead000191d06f"},{"_archived":true,"_draft":false,"date-printed":"2016-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","date-published-online":"2016-08-07T04:00:00.000Z","series":2,"episode":3,"series-title":"Technology // Genetic Engineering","name":"02-03 Technology // Genetic Engineering","social-media-title":"Get Your Genes #Turnt Up and Off with CRISPR","title":"The Low-Down on Gene Editing: CRISPR and Gene Regulation","content":"<p>If you're into the biosciences, you've heard about CRISPR. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its Cas9 nucleases were discovered as part of bacterial immune systems in the 1970s; only in 2012 were they refined into a powerful gene-editing technology.<br></p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 is the new kid on the block, in company with a small list of gene editing techniques such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) which have been around since 1998 and 2009, respectively. What makes CRISPR special is that it's more highly targeted, cheaper, and computer-friendly. You can order a guide RNA (gRNA), the crucial code snippet for gene targeting, online.</p><p>While the technology works well for unicellular bacteria, it is not very effective in complex mammalian cells. By tweaking the software and hardware of this technology, scientists hope to make gains in controlled gene-editing.</p><h4>Bacterial and Human Cells</h4><p>Long before complex multi-cellular organisms like humans were in the picture, single-celled bacteria were our planet's dominant form of life. These bacteria competed and formed alliances with each other, and fought to protect themselves from viral invaders 1/100th their size - and bacteria are microscopic to begin with.</p><p>These viral invaders are short snippets of genetic material that cannot replicate on their own. They need a host to survive, so they sneak through the cell walls of bacteria and inject themselves into its genetic code, creating more of itself. Pretty smart.</p><p>CRISPR came from nature's own toolbox. Eventually, bacteria developed an immune system. It could absorb and remember the invader's genetic code, so that the next time the virus came around, the bacteria could send a nuclease after it, cutting the virus into useless bits. Even smarter.</p><h4>CRISPR Trick #1: Cut-and-Paste DNA</h4><p>\"It's easy to reprogram [CRISPR/Cas] to go anywhere you want,\" says Oliver Medvedik, director of the Maurice Kanbar Center for Biomedical Research in New York City. Using a 20 nucleotide gRNA, the CRISPR/Cas system can easily target and lock onto a specific portion of our 3-billion-nucleotide-long genome.</p><p>Once locked on, it chops the DNA. Since cut-up DNA is about as useful as a cut-up tight rope, the body immediately works to repair the break. Human and mammal cells use two techniques for repair: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR). With CRISPR/Cas9, scientists can deliver a homology, or gene sequence, to insert into the cut site.NHEJ is the default solution but is highly error-prone. The DNA repair systems quickly stick the DNA back together with just about any nucleotides they can find that fit. Usually this knocks out the gene by making it unreadable. In the worse case, it results in a functional mutation that is harmful to the host organism.</p><p>HDR is the preferred solution but occurs with less than 1% efficiency in human stem cells, for example, compared to 95% efficiency in unicellular yeast cells. Medvedik is working on methods to repress the NHEJ response and tweak the Cas enzyme for more efficient HDR repair.</p><h4>CRISPR Trick #2: Turn Off Disease Like a Light Switch</h4><p>Scientists discovered that certain variations of the Cas nuclease, in combination with inhibitor proteins, could sit and lock onto DNA, silencing a selected gene. Modified versions go the other way, and remove inhibitor proteins, turning &nbsp;the genes back on. The technique, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), is 95% effective in silencing genes whereas cutting them using Cas9 resulted in only 60-70% suppression and introduced greater risk.</p><h4>CRISPR and Computers: Meatspace and Cyberspace</h4><p>Previous gene-editing techniques required customized proteins for each gene sequence, an expensive and error-prone process. For CRISPR, changing a 20-nucleotide gRNA sequence is \"ridiculously simple\" and can be done online, says Medvedik.</p><p>He caveats, though, that \"meatspace is different from cyberspace.\" Computers have drastically lower error rates and can run experiments in seconds, while bioengineering techniques run at high error with many months between the question and answer parts of the experiment.</p><h4>Up Next: Business in Genetic Engineering</h4><p>Next week, we'll discuss the ongoing patent dispute deciding who profits from CRISPR use in the marketplace.</p>","short-text":"If you're into the biosciences, you've heard about CRISPR.

How did it happen? How did we go from newborns to taking pleasure in brutal punishments and postcard lynchings?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://withoutsanctuary.org/main.html\">[3]</a></p><h4>3 Billion Years Ago: Scarcity &amp; Collaboration</h4><p>Going back to the beginning, 3 billion years ago, life was a collection of unicellular organisms, swarming around seeking energy from sunlight and other energy sources to complete metabolic functions&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2008/12/metabolicopt.html\">[4]</a>. These organisms are the precursors of our own DNA&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/08/where-animals-come-from/\">[5]</a>. Without energy, these organisms would die.</p><p>This scarcity has been the backbone of our evolution into an animal and then human species. We compete for survival, against other animals, working both with our fellow man and against him. We love, and we murder. We share, and we steal. We welcome, and we shun.</p><p>As humans, we exist on this earth in duality. A mix of yin and yang, dark and light, of hot and cold. Denying the existence of either extreme is a denial of ourselves, a seesaw without the other end. We can’t exist.</p><h4>The Human Mind Today: Fear &amp; Awareness</h4><p>Why would a police officer mistakenly shoot an unarmed black man? Police reports sometimes cite “aggressive stance” or “unknown object”, but is there more to the story? In seeking answers, science comes to our aide, showing that racism is deeply rooted in our minds beyond our own awareness.</p><p>In a 2004 study, 13 white subjects who were proven to be consciously unprejudiced were subliminally shown black faces, quickly flashed for under 0.3 seconds, underneath conscious awareness. The part of their brains that control fear, the amygdala, was activated. However, when shown the image for 0.525 seconds, just long enough for conscious awareness, the fear response was inhibited&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/12/15/study-shows-unconscious-race-bias-found/\">[6]</a>.</p><p>In the case of police actions, where life and death decisions are often made in under a second, the slightest presence of racism may be enough to tip the scales so that an unarmed black man is 5 times more likely to be killed than an unarmed white man&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-police-shootings-race-20160711-story.html\">[7]</a>. The Harvard study shows, though, that just because we might experience race-based fear initially, does not mean that we are biologically compelled to act on it. We have choice.</p><p>It begs the question, where does this fear initially come from?</p><h4>The Inertia of Memories: Eugenics &amp; Story</h4><p>Memories become heavy over time with inertia, grooved into our minds like a deep river. Confirmation bias means that once our minds are set they are hard to change&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2011/05/the-sad-reason-we-reason/\">[8]</a>.</p><p>In the early 1900s the popular science of eugenics swept across the nation and world. Seeking to enhance the gene pool, racial biologists measured skulls searching for correlations between race, violence, and other undesirable behaviors&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/JP_Rushton/Race.htm\">[9]</a>.

Today, we talk about the challenges that biotech startups face in taking these new drugs to market.</p><p>Often, drugs are borne from a university research lab, funded largely by government grants, such as from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). When a marketable drug emerges from the lab, it goes through a tech transfer process. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ygX5zcU5vdg\">[1]</a></p><p>Tracing the journey from lab to marketplace, we follow the story of Drs. Nazneen Dewji and Jonathon Singer as they discover a molecule with potential for treating Alzheimer's disease and create the company <a href=\"http://www.cennabiosciences.com/team.php\">Cenna Biosciences</a>.</p><h4>About Alzheimer's Disease (AD)</h4><p>Over 1 in 10 people over 65 suffer from Alzheimer's, rising to 1 in 2 over the age of 90, affecting over 8 million people today. The disease is marked by cognitive degeneration and memory loss. Many families experience the emotional devastation of slowly watching their parents fade away. Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-a-cure-for-alzheimers-ever-be-found/\">[2]</a></p><p>Since the effects of amyloid plaques, which are implicated in the disease, are irreversible, there is a large market for a preventative drug. Currently, most Alzheimer's drugs inhibit gamma and beta-secretases, which affect 50-60 other chemical process in the brain. <a href=\"http://www.cennabiosciences.com/docs/Cenna_Profiles_SU1604.pdf\">[3]</a></p><p>Taking a drug with such a large off-target effect is not sustainable in the long run, says Dewji. What patients need is a preventative drug for the brain the \"same way that you take statins for heart disease.\"</p><h4>In the Lab: Discovering the Drug and Tech Transfer</h4><p>In 1996, Dewji and Singer began researching pre-senelins, large molecules associated with amyloid beta reduction <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/93/22/12575\">[4]</a>. They noticed that certain peptide groups prevented amyloid beta from forming. Over time, they narrowed down the peptide group to their most promising peptide, P8, with over 50% reduction in amyloid beta. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0122451.PDF\">[5]</a></p><p>In the case of Dewji and Singer, their path to business followed the typical tech transfer process. In 2005, when their research became viable in industry, the University of California San Diego granted them exclusive license to the patent, allowing them to turn their research into a business opportunity.</p><h4>Out of the Lab: Funding and FDA Approval</h4><p>After receiving exclusive license, Dewji and Singer started Cenna Biosciences in 2006. The company is entirely owned by the two founders who invested $646,000 of their own money and raised $13.5 million, mostly in non-diluting NIH grants. <a href=\"http://www.cennabiosciences.com/docs/Cenna_Profiles_SU1604.pdf\">[3]</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn-8qn29diM\">[6]</a></p><p>Currently in the process of seeking investigational drug application (IND) approval from the FDA, they have an added tailwind of a recent change at the NIH, that recently fast-tracked testing using biomarkers. They optimistically hope for 5 years between <a href=\"http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf\">IND approval</a> and reaching the market, hoping to partner with a major pharmaceutical company to assist with <a href=\"http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/rd_brochure_022307.pdf\">Phase II (small) and Phase III (large) human trials</a> and marketing.</p><p>Deciding when to partner is a large and difficult decision for researchers. If they partner too early, the original researchers get diluted and receive a smaller payout for over 20 years of research. Most profit would go to the pharmaceutical company. If they partner too late, they run the risk of investing hundreds of thousands of their own money - into a drug that might not pass clinical trials or that might not succeed in the marketplace. For scale, a human trial for AD can cost over $100 million <a href=\"http://www.biospace.com/News/in-fight-against-alzheimers-100-million-genentech/373974\">[7]</a>.</p><p>Dewji anticipates some trouble taking peptide drugs to market, since they cannot be ingested orally in pill form. Instead it will likely be administered via a nasal spray, allowing the drug to pass directly to the brain through the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Either way it plays out, we can surely be grateful for the scientists doing the basic research that brings new therapies to light for many suffering people alive today and in the future.</p><h4>Wrapping It Up: Drug Design in Medicine</h4><p>The pharmaceutical industry is currently in the classical trial-and-error approach, passing along the high cost of experimentation in drug development to patients. Nanobiotechnology merges physics and biology, opening the doors for physics-based rational drug design. Many biotech startups then take these drugs to market.</p>","tag":"Medicine","short-text":"What patients need is a preventative drug for the brain the \"same way that you take statins for heart disease,\" says Dr. Nazneen Dewji.

Today, we'll talk about how designed proteins can treat diseases like anemia.</p><p>In 1989, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-07/business/fi-1758_1_epo-drug-administration-gave-amgen-amgen-s-executives\">erythropoietin</a> (Epo, pronounced ee-po) was promoted from a natural protein, that makes red blood cells, to a synthesized wonder-drug. It was used not only to treat anemia in cancer patients, but also as a supplement to enhance \"quality of life\" by increasing energy levels. The drug fell from grace, however, in 2011, when the FDA limited dosages, and therefore drug sales, after over-prescriptions and allegations of improper marketing resulted <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/anemia-drug-made-billions-but-at-what-cost/2012/07/19/gJQAX5yqwW_story.html\">in several deaths</a> from blood clotting side effects.</p><p>In April, researchers Jeffrey Way and Devin Burrill with the Wyss Institute eliminated Epo side effects by <a href=\"http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpressrelease/254/designing-better-drugs;jsessionid=34BB09A66AE56C1A9161CF70A1413762.wyss2\">designing and creating a protein-fusion version</a> of the drug.</p><h4>Drug Design Philosophy</h4><p>\"We make drugs that look like what your body would make itself,\" says Dr. Way.</p><p>Epo is a naturally-occurring protein in the body which triggers red blood cell (RBC) production by binding to RBC stem cells in the bone marrow. The problem is that Epo in it's natural form can't tell the difference between an RBC stem cell or a platelet stem cell. If the dose is too high, it triggers the body to make too many platelets, causing blood clotting.</p><p>Way and Burrill, along with other collaborators, designed a drug that is able to differentiate between stem cells, thereby removing the side effect. Here's how they did it.</p><h4>First, Make the Drug Less Reactive</h4><p>The reactive surface of the drug is just a dozen or so atoms out of several thousand which make up the Epo protein. To prevent accidental stem cell interaction, researchers sought to make the reactive area smaller, but how?</p><p>Over several decades, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed to research by creating public libraries full of different genetic mutations of proteins used in drugs.</p><p>The scientists combed through these libraries of genetic modifications, and found three suitable versions to test. Of those three, the mutation of changing one amino acid from an arginine to an alanine, successfully reduced the binding area of the Epo protein to around 10 atoms so that it is small enough to not bind to off-target sites, but large enough to still be effective.</p><h4>Second, Control the Target</h4><p>While Epo proteins on their own tend to attach to whichever stem cell happens to be around, antibodies attach only to very specific targets. Way and Burrill combined the natural ability of an antibody, which seeks and attaches only to red blood cell stem cells, with the reduced-reactivity version of Epo.</p><p>How did they combine these two objects? Kind of like how you or I would, with a piece of (molecular) string!

In this case of selecting a genetic variation of the Epo protein, the current industry standard is to manufacture and test as many mutations as possible in phases until discovering desired proteins. This means thousands of tests starting from test tubes and Petri dishes, progressing to animal testing, and usually taking only one version to human testing.</p><p>Using computer modeling and taking a physics-based approach, the scientists at Wyss were able to select three mutations from several thousand for initial testing, thereby reducing time and cost (see below).</p><p>Way and Burrill, with other collaborators, have started the company General Biologics to take their drug to market.</p><figure data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><div><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u7PUK_bAWE3nLqx28Jw1ENRZtb_GhOf1RGCjPcq0tMlhiF51KRAn_d1KP4tJFXt9Qrzsoxg6AfOKagz9an_d1BwSxI2POxSSnOX3SV_5XU5nTDxYdvjLa3qm_7muSkQy4NzhHSa1\" alt=\"EPOMutation.gif\"></div></figure><h4>Up Next Week: Business in Medicine</h4><p>Learn about how biotech startups take drugs from the lab to the marketplace.</p>","tag":"Medicine, Drugs","cover-image-attributions":"<p>http://arogyamasthu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red_blood_cells.jpg</p>","short-text":"\"We make drugs that look like what your body would make itself,\" says Dr. Way. Epo is a naturally-occurring protein in the body which triggers red blood cell (RBC) production by binding to RBC stem cells in the bone marrow. The problem is that Epo in it's natural form can't tell the difference between an RBC stem cell or a platelet stem cell. If the dose is too high, it triggers the body to make too many platelets, causing blood clotting. Way and Burrill, along with other collaborators, designed a drug that is able to differentiate between stem cells, thereby removing the side effect. Here's how they did it.","slug":"designing-away-the-side-effects-of-a-former-wonder-drug","cover-image":{"fileId":"5a944e17d8dead000191d0fe","url":"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a944e17d8dead000191cf36/5a944e17d8dead000191d0fe_red%20blood%20cells.jpg"},"updated-on":"2018-02-26T19:34:25.804Z","updated-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","created-on":"2016-06-18T01:07:39.161Z","created-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","published-on":"2018-02-26T18:39:29.495Z","published-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","cover-image-background":"#ec0909","publication-info":"Originally published in print on Sunday, 17 June 2016; Vol. 1, Series 1-3 Technology in Medicine: Drug Design","published-online":true,"date-published-online":"2016-09-18T10:27:00.000Z","soundcloud-track-id":271931751,"social-media-title":"Scientists Bring Back Former Wonder-Drug by Removing Side Effects","series-2":"5a944e17d8dead000191cf73","writer":"5a944e17d8dead000191d087","focus":"5a944e17d8dead000191d05a","tags":["5a944e17d8dead000191d096","5a944e17d8dead000191d089"],"featured":true,"_cid":"5a944e17d8dead000191cfd9","_id":"5a944e17d8dead000191d068"},{"_archived":true,"_draft":false,"date-printed":"2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","series":1,"episode":2,"series-title":"Research // Pharma's New Drugs","series-title-2":"Drug Design","name":"01-02 Research // Pharma's New Drugs","title":"(2/4) Research in Medicine: How Alzheimer's and Diabetes Work at the Nano-Scale","content":"<p>Last week, we reviewed how rational drug design has the potential to lower drug prices by cutting the costs of failure in pharmaceutical experiments and development.</p><p>Today, we'll talk about the research that makes drug design possible.

It uses the same tools as biology; tools that were shaped over millions of years of natural evolution. For example, instead of harvesting the anti-malarial drug, Artemisinin, from the plant <em>Artemisia annua</em>, synthetic biologists use genetically modified yeast to ferment the drug in a lab, <a href=\"http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb-PBD-anti-malarial.html\">freeing supply from crop fluctuations</a>. (Although it is interesting to note that the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/synthetic-biology-s-first-malaria-drug-meets-market-resistance-1.19426\">business applications</a> might have backfired).</p><p>In order to practice synthetic biology, we reduce the human body down to its most fundamental level; from groups of organs to bunches of molecules, proteins, and peptides, eventually down to the atomic realm of pinball and electromagnetic physics: a field called nanobiotechnology.</p><h4>At the Micro-scale: Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes</h4><p>Many diseases occur on the macromolecule or protein level, which we can observe easily through microscopes. For example, we have known for the last dozen years that Alzheimer's disease and diabetes share in common large, sticky protein plaques called <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150924124038.htm\">amyloid</a> which collect in the brain and pancreas. An individual plaque is made of many proteins, which are made of even smaller peptides, which themselves are just a handful of atoms. To see at this nano-scale, you need a special electron microscope.</p><h4>Into the Nano-scale: Self-Assembling Peptides</h4><p>Dr. Ehud Gazit, a leader in the field of nanobiotechnology, has been studying how and why these amyloid plaques form for over 15 years. His research shows that these proteins <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11584854_A_possible_role_for_PI-stacking_in_the_self-assembly_of_amyloid_fibrils\">self-assemble</a> because it is energetically advantageous, meaning that they form naturally and on their own. Why is it advantageous? And how can we energetically motivate these plaques not to form?</p><p>To better understand self-assembly, imagine as if the king-sized bed that you ordered from IKEA has a new feature: automatic furniture assembly. You open the box and the bed just puts itself together. That's great, as long as one of your children doesn't peek inside and accidentally open it in the narrow hallway entrance of your home. Then you're stuck with a giant king-sized bed stopping anyone from entering or leaving, wondering if it's even worth your time to take it apart, or if you just want to start sleeping in the entryway.</p><p>Self-assembly isn't all bad, though. Let's take a look at guanine, one of the four peptides that encode our DNA. It also has a tendency to self-assemble. Imagine a primordial goop where suddenly guanine self-assembles and meets other characters of our <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3958828/\">DNA molecule</a>, bumbling around until the primary building blocks meet in just the right orientation. Fast forward several million years and we have humans. It's not only in human DNA that guanine self-assembles, the process is also responsible for the beautiful and vivid color changes in the skin of a <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/42396/title/How-Chameleons-Change-Colors/\">chameleon</a>, (see a cool <a data-rt-link-type=\"external\" href=\"https://youtu.be/w9ecX8PRPSw\">video</a>).</p><p>As we better understand self-assembly, disease, and drug interactions through the languages of biology and physics, we can begin to merge these two fields. For example, we can now <a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05605.x/full\">create moulds for nanoscale semiconductor wires</a> using drinking-straw-shaped amyloid nanotubes that self-assemble.

Common medicines used today, like Tylenol and penicillin, were never designed. We discovered and then manufactured them. In fact,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/one-big-myth-about-medicine-we-know-how-drugs-work/\"> we still don’t know how these drugs work</a>, but we can sure be grateful that they do.</p><h4><strong>A New Way: Drug Design</strong></h4><p>After a decade of Moore’s law of computation rapidly increasing our ability to model complex systems, combined with nano-scale research on how molecules talk to each other, the trend of rational drug design re-emerges, poised to refine away the side effects of existing drugs and lay the groundwork for designing new ones.</p><p>Over the next 3 weeks we will discuss the trend towards design in drug discovery: first by reviewing basic research; second by exploring novel strategies and techniques used to design drugs more effectively; and finally by observing how biotech startups are working to bring these treatments to patients.</p><p>Before we dive in though, let’s check the water level and take a look at the current state of the drug industry.</p><p>One of the largest drivers of cost in the pharmaceutical industry is the high rate of failure and cost of experimentation. On average, 19 out of 20 drugs fail and a human clinical trial, the last step to market, can cost up to<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/\"> $100 million each</a>. Successful drugs cost $1–500 million to develop; if you take the other 19 failed drugs into account, the cost rises to<a href=\"http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study\"> $2.6 billion per drug</a>, with less than 20% of the cost dedicated to development of the successful drug itself. In general, the process often takes over 10 years in time, making drugs both a costly and high risk investment. The higher the risk, the higher the reward needs to be, which can lead to aggressive and hyper-competitive business behavior, often reflected back to consumers in terms of Shkreli-high prices for medicine.</p><p>Is there a way that we can reduce the experimentation phase by prefacing it with rational design? If only 2 out of 3 drugs fail, instead of 19 in 20, you can cut costs by a factor of 4, a savings of nearly $2 billion per drug, enough to bring almost three other drugs to market. It’s a buy-one-get-three-free deal.</p><h4><strong>Where’s the Catch?</strong></h4><p>Our ability to design drugs is limited by a lack of fundamental understanding of the structures of molecules and the physics of drug interactions. Our understanding is limited by how fine our vision is and how fast our brains work. Technological advances allow our vision to become finer, our hands smaller, and our brains faster with the aid of computational power and molecular simulations. By using design and simulations, researchers and drug manufacturers can know which drugs will fail before spending costly human-hours and dollars in development and testing.</p><h4><strong>Up Next Week: Research in Medicine</strong></h4><p>Learn about the new nano-scale research exploring the common molecular and structural roots of diseases like Alzheimer’s and Type II diabetes.</p>","name":"01-01 Trends // Pharma's New Drugs","slug":"01-01-1-trends-in-drug-design","updated-on":"2018-02-26T19:34:27.373Z","updated-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","created-on":"2016-06-17T22:35:54.662Z","created-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","published-on":"2018-02-26T18:39:29.495Z","published-by":"Person_56b506abef4b9c2a5dc7c2e5","date-printed":"2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","series":1,"episode":1,"title":"(1/4) Trends in Medicine: Drug Design Re-Emerges With Potential to Lower Pharma Costs","series-title":"Trends // Pharma's New Drugs","series-title-2":"Drug Design","tag":"Medicine","short-text":"\"If we designed airplanes like we design drugs...\" alludes Walter Woltosz, CEO and Chairman of Simulations Plus, then you probably wouldn't feel very safe on an airplane!
